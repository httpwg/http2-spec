        This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics of the Hypertext
        Transfer Protocol (HTTP), referred to as HTTP version 2 (HTTP/2). HTTP/2 enables a more
        efficient use of network resources and a
        reduced latency by introducing field compression and allowing multiple
        concurrent exchanges on the same connection.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
        The performance of applications using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
        (HTTP, <xref target="HTTP"/>) is linked to how each version of HTTP uses the underlying
        transport, and the conditions under which the transport operates.
      </t>
      <t>
        Making multiple concurrent requests can reduce latency and improve
        application performance. HTTP/1.0 allowed only one request to be
        outstanding at a time on a given TCP <xref target="TCP"/> connection. HTTP/1.1 (<xref target="HTTP11"/>)
        added request pipelining, but this only partially addressed request
        concurrency and still suffers from application-layer head-of-line
        blocking. Therefore, HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 clients use multiple connections
        to a server to make concurrent requests.
      </t>
      <t>
        Furthermore, HTTP fields are often repetitive and verbose, causing unnecessary
        network traffic as well as causing the initial TCP congestion
        window to quickly fill. This can result in excessive latency when multiple requests are
        made on a new TCP connection.
      </t>
      <t>
        HTTP/2 addresses these issues by defining an optimized mapping of HTTP's semantics to an
        underlying connection. Specifically, it allows interleaving of messages on the same
        connection and uses an efficient coding for HTTP fields. It also allows prioritization of
        requests, letting more important requests complete more quickly, further improving
        performance.
      </t>
      <t>
        The resulting protocol is more friendly to the network because fewer TCP connections can
        be used in comparison to HTTP/1.x. This means less competition with other flows and
        longer-lived connections, which in turn lead to better utilization of available network
        capacity. Note, however, that TCP head-of-line blocking is not addressed by this protocol.
      </t>
      <t>
        Finally, HTTP/2 also enables more efficient processing of messages through use of binary
        message framing.

    </section>
    <section anchor="Overview">
      <name>HTTP/2 Protocol Overview</name>
      <t>
        HTTP/2 provides an optimized transport for HTTP semantics.  HTTP/2 supports all of the core
        features of HTTP but aims to be more efficient than HTTP/1.1.
      </t>
      <t>
        The basic protocol unit in HTTP/2 is a <xref target="FrameHeader">frame</xref>.  Each frame
        type serves a different purpose.  For example, <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> and
        <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frames form the basis of <xref target="HttpFraming">HTTP requests and
        responses</xref>; other frame types like <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref>,
        <xref target="WINDOW_UPDATE" format="none">WINDOW_UPDATE</xref>, and <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> are used in support of other
        HTTP/2 features.
      </t>
      <t>
        Multiplexing of requests is achieved by having each HTTP request/response exchange
        associated with its own <xref target="StreamsLayer">stream</xref>. Streams are largely
        independent of each other, so a blocked or stalled request or response does not prevent
        progress on other streams.
      </t>
      <t>
        Effective use of multiplexing depends on flow control and prioritization.  <xref
        target="FlowControl">Flow control</xref> ensures that it is possible to efficiently use
        multiplexed streams by restricting data that is transmitted to what the receiver is able to
        handle.  <xref target="StreamPriority">Prioritization</xref> ensures that limited resources
        are used most effectively.  This revision of HTTP/2 deprecates the priority signaling scheme
        from <xref target="RFC7540"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Because HTTP fields used in a connection can contain large amounts of redundant
        data, frames that contain them are <xref target="FieldBlock">compressed</xref>. This has
        especially advantageous impact upon request sizes in the common case, allowing many
        requests to be compressed into one packet.
      </t>
      <t>
        Finally, HTTP/2 adds a new, optional interaction mode whereby a server can <xref target="PushResources">push
        responses to a client</xref>.  This is intended to allow a server to speculatively send data to a
        client that the server anticipates the client will need, trading off some network usage
        against a potential latency gain.  The server does this by synthesizing a request, which it
        sends as a <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frame.  The server is then able to send a response to
        the synthetic request on a separate stream.
      </t>

        <name>Document Organization</name>
        <t>
          The HTTP/2 specification is split into four parts:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li><xref target="starting">Starting HTTP/2</xref> covers how an HTTP/2 connection is
              initiated.
            </li>
          <li>
              The <xref target="FramingLayer">frame</xref> and <xref target="StreamsLayer">stream</xref> layers describe the way HTTP/2 frames are
              structured and formed into multiplexed streams.
            </li>
          <li><xref target="FrameTypes">Frame</xref> and <xref target="ErrorCodes">error</xref>
              definitions include details of the frame and error types used in HTTP/2.
            </li>
          <li><xref target="HttpLayer">HTTP mappings</xref> and <xref target="HttpExtra">additional
              requirements</xref> describe how HTTP semantics are expressed using frames and
              streams.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          While some of the frame and stream layer concepts are isolated from HTTP, this
          specification does not define a completely generic frame layer. The frame and stream
          layers are tailored to the needs of the HTTP protocol and server push.

          Finally, the terms "gateway", "intermediary", "proxy", and "tunnel" are defined in

        An HTTP/2 connection is an application-layer protocol running on top of a TCP connection
        (<xref target="TCP"/>). The client is the TCP connection initiator.
      </t>
      <t>
        HTTP/2 uses the "http" and "https" URI schemes defined in <xref target="HTTP" section="4.2"/>, with the same default port numbers.  As a result,
        implementations processing requests for target resource URIs like <tt>http://example.org/foo</tt> or <tt>https://example.com/bar</tt> are required to first discover whether the
        upstream server (the immediate peer to which the client wishes to establish a connection)
        supports HTTP/2.
      </t>
      <t>
        The means by which support for HTTP/2 is determined is different for "http" and "https"
        URIs.  Discovery for "https" URIs is described in <xref target="discover-https"/>. HTTP/2
        support for "http" URIs can only be discovered by out-of-band means, and requires prior knowledge
        of the support as described in <xref target="known-http"/>.

        <t>
          The protocol defined in this document has two identifiers. Creating a connection based on
          either implies the use of the transport, framing, and message semantics described in this
          document.

        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>

                The string "h2" identifies the protocol where HTTP/2 uses Transport Layer Security
                (TLS); see <xref target="TLSUsage"/>.  This identifier is used in the <xref
                target="TLS-ALPN">TLS application-layer protocol negotiation (ALPN) extension</xref>
                field and in any place where HTTP/2 over TLS is identified.

                The "h2" string is serialized into an ALPN protocol identifier as the two-octet

            </t>
            <t>
                The "h2c" string is reserved from the ALPN identifier space but describes a protocol
                that does not use TLS.  The security properties of this protocol do not hold unless
                TLS is used; see <xref target="security"/>.

            <t>
                The "h2c" string was previously used as a token for use in the HTTP Upgrade mechanism's
                Upgrade header field (<xref target="HTTP" section="7.8"/>). This usage was never widely
                deployed, and is no longer specified in this document.

          HTTP/2 over TLS uses the "h2" protocol identifier.  The "h2c" protocol identifier MUST NOT

          A client can learn that a particular server supports HTTP/2 by other means.  For example,

        </t>
        <t>
          A client that knows that a server supports HTTP/2 can establish a TCP connection and send
          the <xref target="preface">connection preface</xref> followed by HTTP/2 frames.
          Servers can identify these connections by the presence of the connection preface. This
          only affects the establishment of HTTP/2 connections over cleartext TCP; HTTP/2 connections
          over TLS MUST use <xref target="TLS-ALPN">protocol negotiation in

        <t>
          Without additional information, prior support for HTTP/2 is not a strong signal that a
          given server will support HTTP/2 for future connections. For example, it is possible for
          server configurations to change, for configurations to differ between instances in
          clustered servers, or for network conditions to change.

        <name>HTTP/2 Connection Preface</name>
        <t>
          In HTTP/2, each endpoint is required to send a connection preface as a final confirmation
          of the protocol in use and to establish the initial settings for the HTTP/2 connection.
          The client and server each send a different connection preface.
        </t>
        <t>
          The client connection preface starts with a sequence of 24 octets, which in hex notation
          is:

        <artwork type="inline"><![CDATA[

        <t>
          That is, the connection preface starts with the string <tt>PRI *
          HTTP/2.0\r\n\r\nSM\r\n\r\n</tt>. This sequence
          MUST be followed by a <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frame (<xref target="SETTINGS"/>), which
          MAY be empty. The client sends the client connection preface as the first
          application data octets of a connection.
        </t>
        <aside>
          <t>Note:
            The client connection preface is selected so that a large proportion of HTTP/1.1 or
            HTTP/1.0 servers and intermediaries do not attempt to process further frames.  Note
            that this does not address the concerns raised in <xref target="TALKING"/>.
        </t>
        </aside>
        <t>
          The server connection preface consists of a potentially empty <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref>
          frame (<xref target="SETTINGS"/>) that MUST be the first frame the server sends in the
          HTTP/2 connection.
        </t>
        <t>
          The <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frames received from a peer as part of the connection preface
          MUST be acknowledged (see <xref target="SettingsSync"/>) after sending the connection
          preface.
        </t>
        <t>
          To avoid unnecessary latency, clients are permitted to send additional frames to the
          server immediately after sending the client connection preface, without waiting to receive
          the server connection preface.  It is important to note, however, that the server
          connection preface <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frame might include settings that necessarily
          alter how a client is expected to communicate with the server. Upon receiving the

        <t>
          Field section compression is the process of compressing a set of field lines (<xref target="HTTP" section="5.2"/>) to form a
          field block.  Field section decompression is the process of decoding a field block into a
          set of field lines.  Details of HTTP/2 field section compression and decompression is
          defined in <xref target="COMPRESSION"/>, which, for historical reasons, refers to these
          processes as header compression and decompression.
        </t>
        <t>
          Field blocks carry the compressed bytes of a field section, with header sections
          also carrying control data associated with the message in the form of <xref target="PseudoHeaderFields">pseudo-header fields</xref> that use the same format as a
          field line.
        </t>
        <aside>
          <t>
            Note: <xref target="RFC7540">RFC 7540</xref> used the term "header block" in place of
            the more generic "field block".
          </t>
        </aside>
        <t>
          Field blocks carry control data and header sections for requests, responses, promised
          requests, and pushed responses (see <xref target="PushResources"/>).  All these messages,
          except for interim responses and requests contained in <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frames, can optionally include a field block that
          carries a trailer section.
        </t>
        <t>
          A field section is a collection of field lines.  Each of the field lines in a
          field block carry a single value.  The serialized field block is then divided into one or
          more octet sequences, called field block fragments, and transmitted within the frame
          payload of <xref target="HEADERS">HEADERS</xref> or <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE">PUSH_PROMISE</xref>, each of which could be followed by <xref target="CONTINUATION">CONTINUATION</xref> frames.

          The <xref target="COOKIE">Cookie header field</xref> is treated specially by the HTTP

        </t>
        <t>
          A receiving endpoint reassembles the field block by concatenating its fragments and then
          decompresses the block to reconstruct the field section.
        </t>
        <t>
          A complete field section consists of either:

        <ul spacing="normal">

              a single <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> or <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frame,

          <li>
              a <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> or <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frame with the END_HEADERS
              flag cleared and one or more <xref target="CONTINUATION" format="none">CONTINUATION</xref> frames,

            </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          Field compression is stateful.  One compression context and one decompression context are
          used for the entire connection.  A decoding error in a field block MUST be treated as a
          <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type
          <xref target="COMPRESSION_ERROR" format="none">COMPRESSION_ERROR</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Each field block is processed as a discrete unit.
          Field blocks MUST be transmitted as a contiguous sequence of frames, with no interleaved
          frames of any other type or from any other stream.  The last frame in a sequence of
          <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> or <xref target="CONTINUATION" format="none">CONTINUATION</xref> frames has the END_HEADERS flag set.
          The last frame in a sequence of <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> or <xref target="CONTINUATION" format="none">CONTINUATION</xref>
          frames has the END_HEADERS flag set.  This allows a field block to be logically
          equivalent to a single frame.
        </t>
        <t>
          Field block fragments can only be sent as the frame payload of <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref>,
          <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref>, or <xref target="CONTINUATION" format="none">CONTINUATION</xref> frames because these frames
          carry data that can modify the compression context maintained by a receiver.  An endpoint
          receiving <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref>, <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref>, or
          <xref target="CONTINUATION" format="none">CONTINUATION</xref> frames needs to reassemble field blocks and perform
          decompression even if the frames are to be discarded.  A receiver MUST terminate the
          connection with a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type
          <xref target="COMPRESSION_ERROR" format="none">COMPRESSION_ERROR</xref> if it does not decompress a field block.

        <li>
            Streams can be established and used unilaterally or shared by either the client or

              An endpoint can perform this minimal processing for all streams that are in the

              the frames that caused the stream to enter the "closed" state and treat receipt of any frame other
              than <xref target="PRIORITY" format="none">PRIORITY</xref> as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.  Endpoints can use frames
              that indicate that the peer has received the closing signal to drive this.  Endpoints
              SHOULD NOT use timers for this purpose.  For example, an endpoint that sends a <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frame after closing a stream can
              safely treat receipt of a <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frame on that
              stream as an error after receiving an acknowledgement of the settings.  Other things
              that might be used are <xref target="PING" format="none">PING</xref> frames, receiving
              data on streams that were created after closing the stream, or responses to requests
              created after closing the stream.

          <t>
            Streams are identified with an unsigned 31-bit integer.  Streams initiated by a client
            MUST use odd-numbered stream identifiers; those initiated by the server MUST use
            even-numbered stream identifiers.  A stream identifier of zero (0x0) is used for
            connection control messages; the stream identifier of zero cannot be used to establish a
            new stream.
          </t>
          <t>
            The identifier of a newly established stream MUST be numerically greater than all
            streams that the initiating endpoint has opened or reserved.  This governs streams that
            are opened using a <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> frame and streams that are reserved using
            <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref>.  An endpoint that receives an unexpected stream identifier
            MUST respond with a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of
            type <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.
          </t>
          <t>
            A <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> frame will transition the client-initiated stream identified
            by the stream identifier in the frame header from "idle" to "open". A <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref>
            frame will transition the server-initiated stream identified by the "Promised Stream ID" field in the frame payload from "idle" to "reserved". When
            a stream transitions out of the "idle" state, all streams that might have been initiated by that peer with a lower-valued
            stream identifier are implicitly transitioned to "closed". That is, an endpoint may skip a stream identifier, with the
            effect being that the skipped stream is immediately closed.
          </t>
          <t>
            Stream identifiers cannot be reused.  Long-lived connections can result in an endpoint
            exhausting the available range of stream identifiers.  A client that is unable to
            establish a new stream identifier can establish a new connection for new streams.  A
            server that is unable to establish a new stream identifier can send a
            <xref target="GOAWAY" format="none">GOAWAY</xref> frame so that the client is forced to open a new connection for
            new streams.

            streams setting is specific to each endpoint and applies only to the peer that receives
            the setting. That is, clients specify the maximum number of concurrent streams the

            Streams that are in the "open" state or in either of the "half-closed" states count toward

            these three states count toward the limit advertised in the

        <t>
          Using streams for multiplexing introduces contention over use of the TCP connection,
          resulting in blocked streams.  A flow-control scheme ensures that streams on the same
          connection do not destructively interfere with each other.  Flow control is used for both
          individual streams and for the connection as a whole.

          <t>
            HTTP/2 stream flow control aims to allow a variety of flow-control algorithms to be
            used without requiring protocol changes. Flow control in HTTP/2 has the following

          <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
            <li>
                Flow control is specific to a connection.  Both types of flow control are between
                the endpoints of a single hop and not over the entire end-to-end path.
              </li>
            <li>
                Flow control is based on <xref target="WINDOW_UPDATE" format="none">WINDOW_UPDATE</xref> frames.  Receivers advertise how many octets
                they are prepared to receive on a stream and for the entire connection.  This is a
                credit-based scheme.
              </li>
            <li>
                Flow control is directional with overall control provided by the receiver.  A
                receiver MAY choose to set any window size that it desires for each stream and for
                the entire connection.  A sender MUST respect flow-control limits imposed by a
                receiver.  Clients, servers, and intermediaries all independently advertise their
                flow-control window as a receiver and abide by the flow-control limits set by

            Implementations are also responsible for prioritizing the sending of requests and

          <name>Appropriate Use of Flow Control</name>
          <t>
            Flow control is defined to protect endpoints that are operating under resource
            constraints.  For example, a proxy needs to share memory between many connections and
            also might have a slow upstream connection and a fast downstream one.  Flow-control
            addresses cases where the receiver is unable to process data on one stream yet wants to
            continue to process other streams in the same connection.
          </t>
          <t>
            Deployments that do not require this capability can advertise a flow-control window of
            the maximum size (2<sup>31</sup>-1) and can maintain this window by sending a
            <xref target="WINDOW_UPDATE" format="none">WINDOW_UPDATE</xref> frame when any data is received.  This effectively disables
            flow control for that receiver.  Conversely, a sender is always subject to the
            flow-control window advertised by the receiver.
          </t>
          <t>
            Deployments with constrained resources (for example, memory) can employ flow control to
            limit the amount of memory a peer can consume.  Note, however, that this can lead to
            suboptimal use of available network resources if flow control is enabled without
            knowledge of the bandwidth-delay product (see <xref target="RFC7323"/>).
          </t>
          <t>
            Even with full awareness of the current bandwidth-delay product, implementation of flow
            control can be difficult.  When using flow control, the receiver MUST read from the TCP
            receive buffer in a timely fashion.  Failure to do so could lead to a deadlock when
            critical frames, such as <xref target="WINDOW_UPDATE" format="none">WINDOW_UPDATE</xref>, are not read and acted upon.

            If an endpoint cannot ensure that its peer always has available flow control window space that is greater than the peer's
            bandwidth-delay product on this connection, its receive throughput will be limited by HTTP/2 flow control. This will result
            in degraded performance.

            Sending timely <xref target="WINDOW_UPDATE" format="none">WINDOW_UPDATE</xref> frames can improve performance. Endpoints will
            want to balance the need to improve receive throughput with the need to manage resource exhaustion risks, and should take
            careful note of <xref target="dos"/> in defining their strategy to manage window sizes.

        <t>
          In a multiplexed protocol like HTTP/2, prioritizing allocation of bandwidth and
          computation resources to streams can be critical to attaining good performance.  A poor
          prioritization scheme can result in HTTP/2 providing poor performance.  With no parallelism
          at the TCP layer, performance could be significantly worse than HTTP/1.1.
        </t>
        <t>
          A good prioritization scheme benefits from the application of contextual knowledge such as
          the content of resources, how resources are interrelated, and how those resources will be
          used by a peer.  In particular, clients can possess knowledge about the priority of
          requests that is relevant to server prioritization.  In those cases, having clients
          provide priority information can improve performance.
        </t>
        <section anchor="PriorityHistory">
          <name>Background of Priority in HTTP/2</name>
          <t>
            HTTP/2 included a rich system for signaling priority of requests.  However, this system
            proved to be complex and it was not uniformly implemented.
          </t>
          <t>
            The flexible scheme meant that it was possible for clients to express priorities in very
            different ways, with little consistency in the approaches that were adopted.  For
            servers, implementing generic support for the scheme was complex.  Implementation of
            priorities was uneven in both clients and servers.  Many server deployments ignored
            client signals when prioritizing their handling of requests.
          </t>
          <t>
            In short, the prioritization signaling in <xref target="RFC7540">RFC7540</xref> was not
            successful.

          <name>Priority Signaling in this Document</name>
          <t>
            This update to HTTP/2 deprecates the priority signaling defined in <xref target="RFC7540">RFC 7540</xref>.  The bulk of the text related to priority signals is
            not included in this document.  The description of frame fields and some of the
            mandatory handling is retained to ensure that implementations of this document remain
            interoperable with implementations that use the priority signaling described in RFC
            7540.
          </t>
          <t>
            A thorough description of the RFC 7540 priority scheme remains in <xref target="RFC7540" section="5.3"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
            Signaling priority information is necessary to attain good performance in many cases.
            Where signaling priority information is important, endpoints are encouraged to use an
            alternative scheme, such as <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-priority"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
            Though the priority signaling from RFC 7540 was not widely adopted, the information it
            provides can still be useful in the absence of better information.  Endpoints that
            receive priority signals in <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> or <xref target="PRIORITY" format="none">PRIORITY</xref> frames can benefit from applying that
            information.  In particular, implementations that consume these signals would not
            benefit from discarding these priority signals in the absence of alternatives.
          </t>
          <t>
            Servers SHOULD use other contextual information in determining priority of requests in
            the absence of any priority signals.  Servers MAY interpret the complete absence of
            signals as an indication that the client has not implemented the feature.  The defaults
            described in <xref target="RFC7540" section="5.3.5"/> are known to have poor performance
            under most conditions and their use is unlikely to be deliberate.

          A list of error codes is included in <xref target="ErrorCodes"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          It is possible that an endpoint will encounter frames that would cause multiple errors. Implementations MAY discover
          multiple errors during processing, but they SHOULD report at most one stream and one connection error as a result.
        </t>
        <t>
          The first stream error reported for a given stream prevents any other errors on that stream from being reported.
          In comparison, the protocol permits multiple <xref target="GOAWAY" format="none">GOAWAY</xref> frames, though an
          endpoint SHOULD report just one type of connection error unless an error is encountered during graceful shutdown.
          If this occurs, an endpoint MAY send an additional GOAWAY frame with the new error code, in addition to any prior
          GOAWAY that contained <xref target="NO_ERROR" format="none">NO_ERROR</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>
          If an endpoint detects multiple different errors, it MAY choose to report any one of those
          errors. If a frame causes a connection error, that error MUST be reported.  Additionally,
          an endpoint MAY use any applicable error code when it detects an error condition; a
          generic error code (such as <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref> or <xref target="INTERNAL_ERROR" format="none">INTERNAL_ERROR</xref>) can always be used in place of more specific error
          codes.

            It is possible that the <xref target="GOAWAY" format="none">GOAWAY</xref> will not be reliably received by the

            An endpoint can end a connection at any time.  In particular, an endpoint MAY choose to

          HTTP/2 permits extension of the protocol.  Within the limitations described in this
          section, protocol extensions can be used to provide additional services or alter
          any aspect of the protocol. Extensions are effective only within the scope of a single HTTP/2
          connection.
        </t>
        <t>
          This applies to the protocol elements defined in this document.  This does not affect the
          existing options for extending HTTP, such as defining new methods, status codes, or fields
          (see <xref target="HTTP" section="16"/>).
        </t>
        <t>
          Extensions are permitted to use new <xref target="FrameHeader">frame types</xref>, new
          <xref target="SETTINGS">settings</xref>, or new <xref target="ErrorCodes">error
          codes</xref>.  Registries for managing these extension points are defined in <xref
          section="11" target="RFC7540"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Implementations MUST ignore unknown or unsupported values in all extensible protocol
          elements.  Implementations MUST discard frames that have unknown or unsupported types.
          This means that any of these extension points can be safely used by extensions without
          prior arrangement or negotiation.  However, extension frames that appear in the middle of
          a <xref target="FieldBlock">field block</xref> are not permitted; these MUST be treated
          as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type
          <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Extensions SHOULD avoid changing protocol elements defined in this document or
          elements for which no extension mechanism is defined.  This includes changes to the
          layout of frames, additions or changes to the way that frames are composed into <xref target="HttpFraming">HTTP messages</xref>, the definition of pseudo-header fields, or
          changes to any protocol element that a compliant endpoint might treat as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>
          An extension that changes existing elements MUST be negotiated before being used.  For
          example, an extension that changes the layout of the <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> frame cannot be used until the peer has given a positive
          signal that this is acceptable.  In this case, it could also be necessary to coordinate
          when the revised layout comes into effect.  For example, treating frames other than
          <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frames as flow controlled requires a
          change in semantics that both endpoints need to understand, so this can only be done
          through negotiation.
        </t>
        <t>
          This document doesn't mandate a specific method for negotiating the use of an extension
          but notes that a <xref target="SettingValues">setting</xref> could be used for that
          purpose.  If both peers set a value that indicates willingness to use the extension, then
          the extension can be used.  If a setting is used for extension negotiation, the initial
          value MUST be defined in such a fashion that the extension is initially disabled.

      </t>
      <t>
        The transmission of specific frame types can alter the state of a connection. If endpoints
        fail to maintain a synchronized view of the connection state, successful communication
        within the connection will no longer be possible. Therefore, it is important that endpoints

          The SETTINGS frame (type=0x4) conveys configuration parameters that affect how endpoints
          communicate, such as preferences and constraints on peer behavior.  The SETTINGS frame is
          also used to acknowledge the receipt of those settings.  Individually, a configuration
          parameter from a SETTINGS frame is referred to as a "setting".
        </t>
        <t>
          Settings are not negotiated; they describe characteristics of the sending peer,
          which are used by the receiving peer. Different values for the same setting can be
          advertised by each peer. For example, a client might set a high initial flow-control
          window, whereas a server might set a lower value to conserve resources.
        </t>
        <t>
          A SETTINGS frame MUST be sent by both endpoints at the start of a connection and MAY be
          sent at any other time by either endpoint over the lifetime of the connection.
          Implementations MUST support all of the settings defined by this specification.
        </t>
        <t>
          Each parameter in a SETTINGS frame replaces any existing value for that parameter.
          Settings are processed in the order in which they appear, and a receiver of a SETTINGS
          frame does not need to maintain any state other than the current value of each setting.
          Therefore, the value of a SETTINGS parameter is the last value that is seen by
          a receiver.
        </t>
        <t>
          SETTINGS frames are acknowledged by the receiving peer. To enable this, the SETTINGS
          frame defines the ACK flag:
        </t>
        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
          <dt>ACK (0x1):</dt>
          <dd>
              When set, the ACK flag indicates that this frame acknowledges receipt and application of the
              peer's SETTINGS frame.  When this bit is set, the frame payload of the SETTINGS frame MUST
              be empty.  Receipt of a SETTINGS frame with the ACK flag set and a length field value
              other than 0 MUST be treated as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection
              error</xref> of type <xref target="FRAME_SIZE_ERROR" format="none">FRAME_SIZE_ERROR</xref>.  For more information, see <xref target="SettingsSync"/> ("<xref target="SettingsSync" format="title"/>").
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <t>
          SETTINGS frames always apply to a connection, never a single stream.  The stream
          identifier for a SETTINGS frame MUST be zero (0x0). If an endpoint receives a SETTINGS
          frame whose stream identifier field is anything other than 0x0, the endpoint MUST respond
          with a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type
          <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.
        </t>

        <t>
          A SETTINGS frame with a length other than a multiple of 6 octets MUST be treated as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type

                A PUSH_PROMISE frame without the END_HEADERS flag set MUST be followed by a

        <t>
          PUSH_PROMISE MUST NOT be sent if the <xref target="SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH" format="none">SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH</xref> setting of the

          the PUSH_PROMISE.
        </t>
        <t>
          A PUSH_PROMISE frame modifies the connection state in two ways.  First, the inclusion of a <xref target="FieldBlock">field block</xref> potentially modifies the state maintained for
          field section compression.  Second, PUSH_PROMISE also reserves a stream for later use, causing the
          promised stream to enter the "reserved" state.  A sender MUST NOT send a PUSH_PROMISE on a
          stream unless that stream is either "open" or "half-closed (remote)"; the sender MUST
          ensure that the promised stream is a valid choice for a <xref target="StreamIdentifiers">new stream identifier</xref> (that is, the promised stream MUST
          be in the "idle" state).
        </t>
        <t>
          Since PUSH_PROMISE reserves a stream, ignoring a PUSH_PROMISE frame causes the stream
          state to become indeterminate.  A receiver MUST treat the receipt of a PUSH_PROMISE on a
          stream that is neither "open" nor "half-closed (local)" as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type
          <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.  However, an endpoint that has sent
          <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> on the associated stream MUST handle PUSH_PROMISE frames that
          might have been created before the <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> frame is received and
          processed.
        </t>
        <t>
          A receiver MUST treat the receipt of a PUSH_PROMISE that promises an <xref target="StreamIdentifiers">illegal stream identifier</xref> as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type
          <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>. Note that an illegal stream identifier

          The total number of padding octets is determined by the value of the Pad Length field.  If
          the length of the padding is the length of the frame payload or greater, the recipient

        <name>GOAWAY</name>
        <t>
          The GOAWAY frame (type=0x7) is used to initiate shutdown of a connection or to signal
          serious error conditions.  GOAWAY allows an endpoint to gracefully stop accepting new
          streams while still finishing processing of previously established streams.  This enables
          administrative actions, like server maintenance.
        </t>
        <t>
          There is an inherent race condition between an endpoint starting new streams and the
          remote sending a GOAWAY frame.  To deal with this case, the GOAWAY contains the stream
          identifier of the last peer-initiated stream that was or might be processed on the
          sending endpoint in this connection.  For instance, if the server sends a GOAWAY frame,
          the identified stream is the highest-numbered stream initiated by the client.
        </t>
        <t>
          Once sent, the sender will ignore frames sent on streams initiated by the receiver if the
          stream has an identifier higher than the included last stream identifier.  Receivers of a
          GOAWAY frame MUST NOT open additional streams on the connection, although a new connection
          can be established for new streams.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the receiver of the GOAWAY has sent data on streams with a higher stream identifier
          than what is indicated in the GOAWAY frame, those streams are not or will not be
          processed.  The receiver of the GOAWAY frame can treat the streams as though they had
          never been created at all, thereby allowing those streams to be retried later on a new
          connection.
        </t>
        <t>
          Endpoints SHOULD always send a GOAWAY frame before closing a connection so that the remote
          peer can know whether a stream has been partially processed or not.  For example, if an
          HTTP client sends a POST at the same time that a server closes a connection, the client
          cannot know if the server started to process that POST request if the server does not send
          a GOAWAY frame to indicate what streams it might have acted on.
        </t>
        <t>
          An endpoint might choose to close a connection without sending a GOAWAY for misbehaving
          peers.
        </t>
        <t>
          A GOAWAY frame might not immediately precede closing of the connection; a receiver of a
          GOAWAY that has no more use for the connection SHOULD still send a GOAWAY frame before
          terminating the connection.

          The last stream identifier in the GOAWAY frame contains the highest-numbered stream
          identifier for which the sender of the GOAWAY frame might have taken some action on or
          might yet take action on.  All streams up to and including the identified stream might
          have been processed in some way.  The last stream identifier can be set to 0 if no streams
          were processed.
        </t>
        <aside>
          <t>Note:
            In this context, "processed" means that some data from the stream was passed to some

        </aside>

          If a connection terminates without a GOAWAY frame, the last stream identifier is

          On streams with lower- or equal-numbered identifiers that were not closed completely prior

          activity is not possible, with the exception of idempotent actions like HTTP GET, PUT, or
          DELETE.  Any protocol activity that uses higher-numbered streams can be safely retried
          using a new connection.
        </t>
        <t>
          Activity on streams numbered lower or equal to the last stream identifier might still
          complete successfully.  The sender of a GOAWAY frame might gracefully shut down a
          connection by sending a GOAWAY frame, maintaining the connection in an "open" state until
          all in-progress streams complete.
        </t>
        <t>
          An endpoint MAY send multiple GOAWAY frames if circumstances change.  For instance, an
          endpoint that sends GOAWAY with <xref target="NO_ERROR" format="none">NO_ERROR</xref> during graceful shutdown could
          subsequently encounter a condition that requires immediate termination of the connection.
          The last stream identifier from the last GOAWAY frame received indicates which streams
          could have been acted upon.  Endpoints MUST NOT increase the value they send in the last
          stream identifier, since the peers might already have retried unprocessed requests on
          another connection.
        </t>
        <t>
          A client that is unable to retry requests loses all requests that are in flight when the
          server closes the connection.  This is especially true for intermediaries that might not
          be serving clients using HTTP/2.  A server that is attempting to gracefully shut down a
          connection SHOULD send an initial GOAWAY frame with the last stream identifier set to
          2<sup>31</sup>-1 and a <xref target="NO_ERROR" format="none">NO_ERROR</xref> code.  This signals to the client that
          a shutdown is imminent and that initiating further requests is prohibited.  After allowing
          time for any in-flight stream creation (at least one round-trip time),  the server can
          send another GOAWAY frame with an updated last stream identifier.  This ensures that a
          connection can be cleanly shut down without losing requests.
        </t>
        <t>
          After sending a GOAWAY frame, the sender can discard frames for streams initiated by the
          receiver with identifiers higher than the identified last stream.  However, any frames
          that alter connection state cannot be completely ignored.  For instance,
          <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref>, <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref>, and <xref target="CONTINUATION" format="none">CONTINUATION</xref> frames
          MUST be minimally processed to ensure the state maintained for field section compression is
          consistent (see <xref target="FieldBlock"/>); similarly, DATA frames MUST be counted
          toward the connection flow-control window.  Failure to process these frames can cause flow
          control or field section compression state to become unsynchronized.
        </t>
        <t>
          The GOAWAY frame also contains a 32-bit <xref target="ErrorCodes">error code</xref> that
          contains the reason for closing the connection.
        </t>
        <t>
          Endpoints MAY append opaque data to the frame payload of any GOAWAY frame.  Additional debug
          data is intended for diagnostic purposes only and carries no semantic value.  Debug
          information could contain security- or privacy-sensitive data.  Logged or otherwise
          persistently stored debug data MUST have adequate safeguards to prevent unauthorized
          access.

          The WINDOW_UPDATE frame (type=0x8) is used to implement flow control; see <xref target="FlowControl"/> for an overview.

        <t>
          Flow control operates at two levels: on each individual stream and on the entire

        </t>
        <t>
          Both types of flow control are hop by hop, that is, only between the two endpoints.
          Intermediaries do not forward WINDOW_UPDATE frames between dependent connections.
          However, throttling of data transfer by any receiver can indirectly cause the propagation
          of flow-control information toward the original sender.
        </t>
        <t>
          Flow control only applies to frames that are identified as being subject to flow control.
          Of the frame types defined in this document, this includes only <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frames.
          Frames that are exempt from flow control MUST be accepted and processed, unless the
          receiver is unable to assign resources to handling the frame.  A receiver MAY respond with
          a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream error</xref> or <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type
          <xref target="FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR" format="none">FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR</xref> if it is unable to accept a frame.

          The frame payload of a WINDOW_UPDATE frame is one reserved bit plus an unsigned 31-bit integer
          indicating the number of octets that the sender can transmit in addition to the existing
          flow-control window.  The legal range for the increment to the flow-control window is 1 to

        <t>
          The WINDOW_UPDATE frame can be specific to a stream or to the entire connection.  In the
          former case, the frame's stream identifier indicates the affected stream; in the latter,
          the value "0" indicates that the entire connection is the subject of the frame.
        </t>
        <t>
          A receiver MUST treat the receipt of a WINDOW_UPDATE frame with an flow-control window
          increment of 0 as a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream error</xref> of type

        <t>
          WINDOW_UPDATE can be sent by a peer that has sent a frame with the END_STREAM flag set.
          This means that a receiver could receive a WINDOW_UPDATE frame on a "half-closed (remote)"
          or "closed" stream.  A receiver MUST NOT treat this as an error (see <xref target="StreamStates"/>).

          A receiver that receives a flow-controlled frame MUST always account for its contribution
          against the connection flow-control window, unless the receiver treats this as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref>.  This is necessary even if the
          frame is in error.  The sender counts the frame toward the flow-control window, but if
          the receiver does not, the flow-control window at the sender and receiver can become
          different.

          <name>The Flow-Control Window</name>
          <t>
            Flow control in HTTP/2 is implemented using a window kept by each sender on every
            stream. The flow-control window is a simple integer value that indicates how many octets
            of data the sender is permitted to transmit; as such, its size is a measure of the
            buffering capacity of the receiver.
          </t>
          <t>
            Two flow-control windows are applicable: the stream flow-control window and the
            connection flow-control window.  The sender MUST NOT send a flow-controlled frame with a
            length that exceeds the space available in either of the flow-control windows advertised
            by the receiver.  Frames with zero length with the END_STREAM flag set (that is, an
            empty <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frame) MAY be sent if there is no available space in either
            flow-control window.
          </t>
          <t>
            For flow-control calculations, the 9-octet frame header is not counted.
          </t>
          <t>
            After sending a flow-controlled frame, the sender reduces the space available in both
            windows by the length of the transmitted frame.
          </t>
          <t>
            The receiver of a frame sends a WINDOW_UPDATE frame as it consumes data and frees up
            space in flow-control windows.  Separate WINDOW_UPDATE frames are sent for the stream-
            and connection-level flow-control windows.
          </t>
          <t>
            A sender that receives a WINDOW_UPDATE frame updates the corresponding window by the
            amount specified in the frame.
          </t>
          <t>
            A sender MUST NOT allow a flow-control window to exceed 2<sup>31</sup>-1 octets.
            If a sender receives a WINDOW_UPDATE that causes a flow-control window to exceed this
            maximum, it MUST terminate either the stream or the connection, as appropriate.  For
            streams, the sender sends a <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> with an error code of
            <xref target="FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR" format="none">FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR</xref>; for the connection, a <xref target="GOAWAY" format="none">GOAWAY</xref>
            frame with an error code of <xref target="FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR" format="none">FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR</xref> is sent.
          </t>
          <t>
            Flow-controlled frames from the sender and WINDOW_UPDATE frames from the receiver are
            completely asynchronous with respect to each other. This property allows a receiver to
            aggressively update the window size kept by the sender to prevent streams from stalling.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="InitialWindowSize">
          <name>Initial Flow-Control Window Size</name>
          <t>
            When an HTTP/2 connection is first established, new streams are created with an initial
            flow-control window size of 65,535 octets. The connection flow-control window is also 65,535
            octets. Both endpoints can adjust the initial window size for new streams by including
            a value for <xref target="SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE" format="none">SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</xref> in the <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref>
            frame that forms part of the connection preface. The connection flow-control window can
            only be changed using WINDOW_UPDATE frames.
          </t>
          <t>
            Prior to receiving a <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frame that sets a value for
            <xref target="SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE" format="none">SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</xref>, an endpoint can only use the default
            initial window size when sending flow-controlled frames.  Similarly, the connection flow-control
            window is set to the default initial window size until a WINDOW_UPDATE frame is
            received.
          </t>
          <t>
            In addition to changing the flow-control window for streams that are not yet active, a
            <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frame can alter the initial flow-control window size for streams
            with active flow-control windows (that is, streams in the "open" or "half-closed
            (remote)" state).  When the value of <xref target="SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE" format="none">SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</xref>
            changes, a receiver MUST adjust the size of all stream flow-control windows that it
            maintains by the difference between the new value and the old value.
          </t>
          <t>
            A change to <xref target="SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE" format="none">SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</xref> can cause the available space in
            a flow-control window to become negative.  A sender MUST track the negative flow-control
            window and MUST NOT send new flow-controlled frames until it receives WINDOW_UPDATE
            frames that cause the flow-control window to become positive.
          </t>
          <t>
            For example, if the client sends 60 KB immediately on connection establishment and the
            server sets the initial window size to be 16 KB, the client will recalculate the
            available flow-control window to be -44 KB on receipt of the <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref>
            frame.  The client retains a negative flow-control window until WINDOW_UPDATE frames
            restore the window to being positive, after which the client can resume sending.
          </t>
          <t>
            A <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frame cannot alter the connection flow-control window.
          </t>
          <t>
            An endpoint MUST treat a change to <xref target="SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE" format="none">SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</xref> that
            causes any flow-control window to exceed the maximum size as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type

            A receiver that wishes to use a smaller flow-control window than the current size can
            send a new <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frame.  However, the receiver MUST be prepared to
            receive data that exceeds this window size, since the sender might send data that
            exceeds the lower limit prior to processing the <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frame.
          </t>
          <t>
            After sending a SETTINGS frame that reduces the initial flow-control window size, a
            receiver MAY continue to process streams that exceed flow-control limits.  Allowing
            streams to continue does not allow the receiver to immediately reduce the space it
            reserves for flow-control windows.  Progress on these streams can also stall, since
            <xref target="WINDOW_UPDATE" format="none">WINDOW_UPDATE</xref> frames are needed to allow the sender to resume sending.
            The receiver MAY instead send a <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> with an error code of

        <t>
          For a response only, a server MAY send any number of interim responses before the <xref
          target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> frame containing a final response. An
          interim response consists of a <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> frame
          (which might be followed by zero or more <xref target="CONTINUATION"
          format="none">CONTINUATION</xref> frames) containing the control data and header section
          of an interim (1xx) HTTP response (see <xref target="HTTP" section="15"/>). A <xref

          an informational status code is <xref target="malformed">malformed</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>
          The last frame in the sequence bears an END_STREAM flag, noting that a <xref

        </t>
        <t>
          Other frames (from any stream) MUST NOT occur between the <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> frame

          Trailer fields are carried in a field block that also terminates the stream. That is,

          An HTTP request/response exchange fully consumes a single stream. A request starts with
          the <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> frame that puts the stream into
          the "open" state. The request ends with a frame with the END_STREAM flag set, which causes the
          stream to become "half-closed (local)" for the client and "half-closed (remote)" for the
          server. A response stream starts with zero or more interim responses in <xref
          target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> frames, followed by a <xref target="HEADERS"
          format="none">HEADERS</xref> frame containing a final status code.
        </t>
        <t>
          An HTTP response is complete after the server sends -- or the client receives -- a frame
          with the END_STREAM flag set (including any <xref target="CONTINUATION"
          format="none">CONTINUATION</xref> frames needed to complete a field block). A server can
          send a complete response prior to the client sending an entire request if the response
          does not depend on any portion of the request that has not been sent and received. When
          this is true, a server MAY request that the client abort transmission of a request
          without error by sending a <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> with
          an error code of <xref target="NO_ERROR" format="none">NO_ERROR</xref> after sending a
          complete response (i.e., a frame with the END_STREAM flag set). Clients MUST NOT discard
          responses as a result of receiving such a <xref target="RST_STREAM"
          format="none">RST_STREAM</xref>, though clients can always discard responses at their
          discretion for other reasons.

          <t>
            A malformed request or response is one that is an otherwise valid sequence of HTTP/2
            frames but is invalid due to the presence of extraneous frames, prohibited fields or
            pseudo-header fields, the absence of mandatory pseudo-header fields, the inclusion of
            uppercase field names, or invalid field names and/or values (in certain circumstances;

            A request or response that includes message content can include a
            <tt>content-length</tt> header field. A request or response is also malformed if the
            value of a <tt>content-length</tt> header field does not equal the sum of the <xref
            target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frame payload lengths that form the content.
            A response that is defined to have no content, as described in <xref target="HTTP"
            section="6.4"/>, can have a non-zero <tt>content-length</tt> header field, even
            though no content is included in <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frames.

          <t>
            Intermediaries that process HTTP requests or responses (i.e., any intermediary not
            acting as a tunnel) MUST NOT forward a malformed request or response. Malformed
            requests or responses that are detected MUST be treated as a <xref

            format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.
          </t>
          <t>
            For malformed requests, a server MAY send an HTTP response prior to closing or
            resetting the stream.  Clients MUST NOT accept a malformed response.
          </t>
          <t>
            Endpoints that progressively process messages might have performed some processing
            before identifying a request or response as malformed. For instance, it might be
            possible to generate an informational or 404 status code without having received a
            complete request. Similarly, intermediaries might forward incomplete messages before
            detecting errors. A server MAY generate a final response before receiving an entire
            request when the response does not depend on the remainder of the request being
            correct. A server or intermediary MAY use <xref target="RST_STREAM"
            format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> -- with a code other than <xref
            target="REFUSED_STREAM" format="none">REFUSED_STREAM</xref> -- to abort a stream if a

            These requirements are intended to protect against several types of common attacks

        <name>Server Push</name>
        <t>
          HTTP/2 allows a server to pre-emptively send (or "push") responses (along with
          corresponding "promised" requests) to a client in association with a previous
          client-initiated request.
        </t>
        <t>
          Server push was designed to allow a server to improve client-perceived performance by
          predicting what requests will follow those that it receives, thereby removing a round
          trip for them. For example, a request for HTML is often followed by requests
          for stylesheets and scripts referenced by that page. When these requests
          are pushed, the client does not need to wait to receive the references to them in the HTML
          and issue separate requests.
        </t>
        <t>
          In practice, server push is difficult to use effectively, because it requires the
          server to correctly anticipate the additional requests the client will make, taking into
          account factors such as caching, content negotiation, and user behavior. Errors in
          prediction can lead to performance degradation, due to the opportunity cost that the
          additional data on the wire represents. In particular, pushing any significant amount of
          data can cause contention issues with more-important responses.
        </t>
        <t>
          A client can request that server push be disabled, though this is negotiated for each hop
          independently. The <xref target="SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH"
          format="none">SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH</xref> setting can be set to 0 to indicate that server
          push is disabled.
        </t>
        <t>
          Promised requests MUST be safe (see <xref target="HTTP" section="9.2.1"/>) and cacheable
          (see <xref target="HTTP" section="9.2.3"/>). Promised requests cannot include any content
          or a trailer section. Clients that receive a promised request that is not cacheable, that
          is not known to be safe, or that indicates the presence of request content MUST reset the
          promised stream with a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream error</xref> of type
          <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>. Note this could result
          in the promised stream being reset if the client does not recognize a newly defined
          method as being safe.
        </t>
        <t>
          Pushed responses that are cacheable (see <xref target="CACHE" section="3"/>) can be
          stored by the client, if it implements an HTTP cache. Pushed responses are considered
          successfully validated on the origin server (e.g., if the "no-cache" cache response
          directive is present; see <xref target="CACHE" section="5.2.2.4"/>) while the stream
          identified by the promised stream ID is still open.
        </t>
        <t>
          Pushed responses that are not cacheable MUST NOT be stored by any HTTP cache. They MAY
          be made available to the application separately.
        </t>
        <t>
          The server MUST include a value in the <tt>:authority</tt> pseudo-header field for which
          the server is authoritative (see <xref target="authority"/>). A client MUST treat a <xref
          target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> for which the server is not
          authoritative as a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream error</xref> of type <xref
          target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>
          An intermediary can receive pushes from the server and choose not to forward them on to
          the client. In other words, how to make use of the pushed information is up to that
          intermediary. Equally, the intermediary might choose to make additional pushes to the
          client, without any action taken by the server.
        </t>
        <t>
          A client cannot push. Thus, servers MUST treat the receipt of a <xref
          target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frame as a <xref
          target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type <xref
          target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>. A server cannot set the
          <xref target="SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH" format="none">SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH</xref> setting to
          a value other than 0 (see <xref target="SettingValues"/>).

            Server push is semantically equivalent to a server responding to a request; however, in
            this case, that request is also sent by the server, as a <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref>
            frame.

          <t>
            The <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frame includes a
            field block that contains control data and a complete
            set of request header fields that the server attributes to the request. It is not
            possible to push a response to a request that includes message content.
          </t>
          <t>
            Promised requests are always associated with an explicit request from the client. The
            <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frames sent by the server are sent on that explicit
            request's stream. The <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frame also includes a promised stream

            MUST be a valid and complete set of <xref target="HttpRequest">request header

            field that is safe and cacheable. If a client receives a <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE"
            format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> that does not include a complete and valid set of
            header fields or the <tt>:method</tt> pseudo-header field identifies a method that is
            not safe, it MUST respond with a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream error</xref>

            (<xref target="PUSH_PROMISE"/>) frames prior to sending any frames that reference the
            promised responses. This avoids a race where clients issue requests prior to receiving

          <t>
            For example, if the server receives a request for a document containing embedded links
            to multiple image files and the server chooses to push those additional images to the
            client, sending <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frames
            before the <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frames that contain the image
            links ensures that the client is able to see that a resource will be pushed before
            discovering embedded links. Similarly, if the server pushes resources referenced by the
            field block (for instance, in Link header fields), sending a <xref
            target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> before sending the header

            Sending a <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frame creates a new stream and puts the stream

            After sending the <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frame,

            Once a client receives a <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frame and chooses to accept the

          TCP server; data received from the TCP server is assembled into <xref target="DATA"
          format="none">DATA</xref> frames by the proxy. Frame types other than <xref target="DATA"
          format="none">DATA</xref> or stream management frames (<xref target="RST_STREAM"
          format="none">RST_STREAM</xref>, <xref target="WINDOW_UPDATE"
          format="none">WINDOW_UPDATE</xref>, and <xref target="PRIORITY"
          format="none">PRIORITY</xref>) MUST NOT be sent on a connected stream and MUST be treated
          as a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream error</xref> if received.
        </t>
        <t>
          The TCP connection can be closed by either peer.  The END_STREAM flag on a
          <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frame is treated as being equivalent to the TCP FIN bit.  A client is
          expected to send a <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frame with the END_STREAM flag set after receiving
          a frame with the END_STREAM flag set.  A proxy that receives a <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frame
          with the END_STREAM flag set sends the attached data with the FIN bit set on the last TCP
          segment.  A proxy that receives a TCP segment with the FIN bit set sends a
          <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frame with the END_STREAM flag set.  Note that the final TCP segment
          or <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frame could be empty.
        </t>
        <t>
          A TCP connection error is signaled with <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref>.  A proxy treats any
          error in the TCP connection, which includes receiving a TCP segment with the RST bit set,
          as a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream error</xref> of type
          <xref target="CONNECT_ERROR" format="none">CONNECT_ERROR</xref>.  Correspondingly, a proxy MUST send a TCP segment with the
          RST bit set if it detects an error with the stream or the HTTP/2 connection.

        <t>
          In general, an HTTP client is unable to retry a non-idempotent request when an error
          occurs because there is no means to determine the nature of the error (see <xref target="HTTP" section="9.2.2"/>).  It is possible
          that some server processing occurred prior to the error, which could result in
          undesirable effects if the request were reattempted.
        </t>
        <t>
          HTTP/2 provides two mechanisms for providing a guarantee to a client that a request has
          not been processed:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
              The <xref target="GOAWAY" format="none">GOAWAY</xref> frame indicates the highest stream number that might have
              been processed.  Requests on streams with higher numbers are therefore guaranteed to
              be safe to retry.
            </li>
          <li>
              The <xref target="REFUSED_STREAM" format="none">REFUSED_STREAM</xref> error code can be included in a
              <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> frame to indicate that the stream is being closed prior to
              any processing having occurred.  Any request that was sent on the reset stream can
              be safely retried.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          Requests that have not been processed have not failed; clients MAY automatically retry
          them, even those with non-idempotent methods.
        </t>
        <t>
          A server MUST NOT indicate that a stream has not been processed unless it can guarantee
          that fact.  If frames that are on a stream are passed to the application layer for any
          stream, then <xref target="REFUSED_STREAM" format="none">REFUSED_STREAM</xref> MUST NOT be used for that stream, and a
          <xref target="GOAWAY" format="none">GOAWAY</xref> frame MUST include a stream identifier that is greater than or
          equal to the given stream identifier.
        </t>
        <t>
          In addition to these mechanisms, the <xref target="PING" format="none">PING</xref> frame provides a way for a
          client to easily test a connection.  Connections that remain idle can become broken as
          some middleboxes (for instance, network address translators or load balancers) silently
          discard connection bindings.  The <xref target="PING" format="none">PING</xref> frame allows a client to safely
          test whether a connection is still active without sending a request.

        <t>
          HTTP/2 connections are persistent.  For best performance, it is expected that clients will not
          close connections until it is determined that no further communication with a server is
          necessary (for example, when a user navigates away from a particular web page) or until
          the server closes the connection.
        </t>
        <t>
          Clients SHOULD NOT open more than one HTTP/2 connection to a given host and port pair,
          where the host is derived from a URI, a selected <xref target="ALT-SVC">alternative
          service</xref>, or a configured proxy.
        </t>
        <t>
          A client can create additional connections as replacements, either to replace connections
          that are near to exhausting the available <xref target="StreamIdentifiers">stream
          identifier space</xref>, to refresh the keying material for a TLS connection, or to
          replace connections that have encountered <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">errors</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>
          A client MAY open multiple connections to the same IP address and TCP port using different
          <xref target="TLS-EXT">Server Name Indication</xref> values or to provide different TLS
          client certificates but SHOULD avoid creating multiple connections with the same
          configuration.
        </t>
        <t>
          Servers are encouraged to maintain open connections for as long as possible but are
          permitted to terminate idle connections if necessary.  When either endpoint chooses to
          close the transport-layer TCP connection, the terminating endpoint SHOULD first send a
          <xref target="GOAWAY" format="none">GOAWAY</xref> (<xref target="GOAWAY"/>) frame so that both endpoints can reliably
          determine whether previously sent frames have been processed and gracefully complete or
          terminate any necessary remaining tasks.

        <section anchor="reuse">
          <name>Connection Reuse</name>
          <t>
            Connections that are made to an origin server, either directly or through a tunnel
            created using the <xref target="CONNECT">CONNECT method</xref>, MAY be reused for
            requests with multiple different URI authority components.  A connection can be reused
            as long as the origin server is <xref target="authority">authoritative</xref>.  For TCP
            connections without TLS, this depends on the host having resolved to the same IP
            address.
          </t>
          <t>
            For <tt>https</tt> resources, connection reuse additionally depends
            on having a certificate that is valid for the host in the URI.  The certificate
            presented by the server MUST satisfy any checks that the client would perform when
            forming a new TLS connection for the host in the URI.  A single certificate can be
            used to establish authority for multiple origins.  <xref target="HTTP" section="4.3"/>
            describes how a client determines whether a server is authoritative for a URI.
          </t>
          <t>
            In some deployments, reusing a connection for multiple origins can result in requests
            being directed to the wrong origin server.  For example, TLS termination might be
            performed by a middlebox that uses the TLS <xref target="TLS-EXT">Server Name Indication
            (SNI)</xref> extension to select an origin server.  This means that it is possible
            for clients to send requests to servers that might not be the intended
            target for the request, even though the server is otherwise authoritative.
          </t>
          <t>
            A server that does not wish clients to reuse connections can indicate that it is not
            authoritative for a request by sending a 421 (Misdirected Request) status code in response
            to the request (see <xref target="HTTP" section="15.5.20"/>).
          </t>
          <t>
            A client that is configured to use a proxy over HTTP/2 directs requests to that proxy
            through a single connection.  That is, all requests sent via a proxy reuse the
            connection to the proxy.

            when these restrictions are not met. An endpoint MAY immediately terminate an HTTP/2
            connection that does not meet these TLS requirements with a <xref
            target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type <xref
            target="INADEQUATE_SECURITY" format="none">INADEQUATE_SECURITY</xref>.

          </t>
          <t>
            A deployment of HTTP/2 over TLS 1.2 MUST disable compression. TLS compression can lead
            to the exposure of information that would not otherwise be revealed <xref
            target="RFC3749"/>. Generic compression is unnecessary since HTTP/2 provides
            compression features that are more aware of context and therefore likely to be more
            appropriate for use for performance, security, or other reasons.

          </t>
          <t>
            A deployment of HTTP/2 over TLS 1.2 MUST disable renegotiation. An endpoint MUST treat
            a TLS renegotiation as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref>
            of type <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>. Note that
            disabling renegotiation can result in long-lived connections becoming unusable due to
            limits on the number of messages the underlying cipher suite can encipher.

          </t>
          <t>
            An endpoint MAY use renegotiation to provide confidentiality protection for client
            credentials offered in the handshake, but any renegotiation MUST occur prior to sending
            the connection preface.  A server SHOULD request a client certificate if it sees a
            renegotiation request immediately after establishing a connection.
          </t>
          <t>
            This effectively prevents the use of renegotiation in response to a request for a
            specific protected resource.  A future specification might provide a way to support this
            use case. Alternatively, a server might use an <xref target="ErrorHandler">
            error</xref> of type <xref target="HTTP_1_1_REQUIRED" format="none">HTTP_1_1_REQUIRED</xref> to request the client
            use a protocol that supports renegotiation.
          </t>
          <t>
            Implementations MUST support ephemeral key exchange sizes of at least 2048 bits for
            cipher suites that use ephemeral finite field Diffie-Hellman (DHE) <xref
            target="TLS13"/> and 224 bits for cipher suites that use ephemeral elliptic curve
            Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) <xref target="RFC8422"/>. Clients MUST accept DHE sizes of up to
            4096 bits. Endpoints MAY treat negotiation of key sizes smaller than the lower limits
            as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type <xref

            format="none">INADEQUATE_SECURITY</xref> if one of the prohibited cipher suites is
            negotiated. A deployment that chooses to use a prohibited cipher suite risks triggering
            a connection error unless the set of potential peers is known to accept that cipher
            suite.

          </t>
          <t>
            Implementations MUST NOT generate this error in reaction to the negotiation of a cipher
            suite that is not prohibited.  Consequently, when clients offer a cipher suite
            that is not prohibited, they have to be prepared to use that cipher suite with
            HTTP/2.
          </t>
          <t>
            The list of prohibited cipher suites includes the cipher suite that TLS 1.2 makes mandatory,
            which means that TLS 1.2 deployments could have non-intersecting sets of permitted cipher
            suites.  To avoid this problem causing TLS handshake failures, deployments of HTTP/2 that use
            TLS 1.2 MUST support TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 <xref target="TLS-ECDHE"/> with
            the P-256 elliptic curve <xref target="FIPS186"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
            Note that clients might advertise support of cipher suites that are prohibited in
            order to allow for connection to servers that do not support HTTP/2.  This allows
            servers to select HTTP/1.1 with a cipher suite that is prohibited in HTTP/2.
            However, this can result in HTTP/2 being negotiated with a prohibited cipher suite if
            the application protocol and cipher suite are independently selected.

          <t>
            HTTP/2 servers MUST NOT send post-handshake TLS 1.3 CertificateRequest messages. HTTP/2

          <t>
            The prohibition on post-handshake authentication applies even if the client offered the
            "post_handshake_auth" TLS extension.  Post-handshake authentication support might be
            advertised independently of <xref target="TLS-ALPN">ALPN</xref>.  Clients might offer
            the capability for use in other protocols, but inclusion of the extension cannot imply

        <name>Cross-Protocol Attacks</name>
        <t>
          In a cross-protocol attack, an attacker causes a client to initiate a transaction in one
          protocol toward a server that understands a different protocol.  An attacker might be able
          to cause the transaction to appear as a valid transaction in the second protocol.  In
          combination with the capabilities of the web context, this can be used to interact with
          poorly protected servers in private networks.
        </t>
        <t>
          Completing a TLS handshake with an ALPN identifier for HTTP/2 can be considered sufficient
          protection against cross-protocol attacks.  ALPN provides a positive indication that a
          server is willing to proceed with HTTP/2, which prevents attacks on other TLS-based
          protocols.
        </t>
        <t>
          The encryption in TLS makes it difficult for attackers to control the data that could be
          used in a cross-protocol attack on a cleartext protocol.
        </t>
        <t>
          The cleartext version of HTTP/2 has minimal protection against cross-protocol attacks.
          The <xref target="preface">connection preface</xref> contains a string that is

        <name>Intermediary Encapsulation Attacks</name>
        <t>
          HPACK permits encoding of field names and values that might be treated as delimiters in
          other HTTP versions.  An intermediary that translates an HTTP/2 request or response MUST
          validate fields according to the rules in <xref target="HttpHeaders"/> roles before
          translating a message to another HTTP version.  Translating a field that includes invalid
          delimiters could be used to cause recipients to incorrectly interpret a message, which
          could be exploited by an attacker.
        </t>
        <t>
          An intermediary can reject fields that contain invalid field names or values for other
          reasons, in particular those that do not conform to the HTTP ABNF grammar from <xref target="HTTP" section="5"/>. Intermediaries that do not perform any validation of fields
          other than the minimum required by <xref target="HttpHeaders"/> could forward messages
          that contain invalid field names or values.
        </t>
        <t>
          An intermediary that receives any field that requires removal before forwarding
          (see <xref target="HTTP" section="7.6.1"/>) MUST remove or replace those header fields when
          forwarding messages. Additionally, intermediaries should take care when forwarding messages
          containing Content-Length fields to ensure that the message is <xref target="malformed">well-formed</xref>.
          This ensures that if the message is translated into HTTP/1.1 at any point the framing will be correct.

        <name>Cacheability of Pushed Responses</name>
        <t>
          Pushed responses do not have an explicit request from the client; the request
          is provided by the server in the <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frame.
        </t>
        <t>
          Caching responses that are pushed is possible based on the guidance provided by the origin
          server in the Cache-Control header field.  However, this can cause issues if a single
          server hosts more than one tenant.  For example, a server might offer multiple users each
          a small portion of its URI space.
        </t>
        <t>
          Where multiple tenants share space on the same server, that server MUST ensure that
          tenants are not able to push representations of resources that they do not have authority
          over.  Failure to enforce this would allow a tenant to provide a representation that would
          be served out of cache, overriding the actual representation that the authoritative tenant
          provides.
        </t>
        <t>
          Pushed responses for which an origin server is not authoritative (see

          An HTTP/2 connection can demand a greater commitment of resources to operate than an

          A number of HTTP/2 implementations were found to be vulnerable to denial of service <xref target="NFLX-2019-002"/>.  The following lists known ways that implementations might be
          subject to denial of service attack:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <t>
              Inefficient tracking of outstanding outbound frames can lead to overload if an adversary can
              cause large numbers of frames to be enqueued for sending.  A peer could use one of
              several techniques to cause large numbers of frames to be generated:
            </t>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Providing tiny increments to flow control in <xref target="WINDOW_UPDATE" format="none">WINDOW_UPDATE</xref> frames can cause a sender to generate a large
                number of <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frames.
              </li>
              <li>
                An endpoint is required to respond to a <xref target="PING" format="none">PING</xref> frame.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frame requires

              </li>
              <li>
                An invalid request (or server push) can cause a peer to send <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> frames in response.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Large numbers of small or empty frames can be abused to cause a peer to expend time
            processing frame headers.  Caution is required here as some uses of small frames are
            entirely legitimate, such as the sending of an empty <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> or <xref target="CONTINUATION" format="none">CONTINUATION</xref> frame at the end of a stream.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frame might also be abused to
            cause a peer to expend additional processing time.  This might be done by pointlessly
            changing settings, sending multiple undefined settings, or changing the
            same setting multiple times in the same frame.
          </li>
          <li>
            Handling reprioritization with <xref target="PRIORITY" format="none">PRIORITY</xref>
            frames can require significant processing time and can lead to overload if many <xref target="PRIORITY" format="none">PRIORITY</xref> frames are sent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Field section compression also offers some opportunities to waste processing resources; see

          </li>
          <li>
            Limits in <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> cannot be reduced
            instantaneously, which leaves an endpoint exposed to behavior from a peer that could
            exceed the new limits. In particular, immediately after establishing a connection,
            limits set by a server are not known to clients and could be exceeded without being an
            obvious protocol violation.
          </li>
          <li>
            An attacker can provide large amounts of flow control credit at the HTTP/2 layer, but
            withhold credit at the TCP layer, preventing frames from being sent.  An endpoint that
            constructs and remembers frames for sending without considering TCP limits might be
            subject to resource exhaustion.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          Most of the features that might be exploited for denial of service -- i.e., <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> changes, small frames, field section
          compression -- have legitimate uses.  These features become a burden only when they are
          used unnecessarily or to excess.
        </t>
        <t>
          An endpoint that doesn't monitor use of these features exposes itself to a risk of
          denial of service.  Implementations SHOULD track the use of these features and set

            commit a large amount of state.  Field lines that are critical for routing can appear
            toward the end of a field block, which prevents streaming of fields to their
            ultimate destination.  This ordering and other reasons, such as ensuring cache
            correctness, mean that an endpoint might need to buffer the entire field block.  Since
            there is no hard limit to the size of a field block, some endpoints could be forced to
            commit a large amount of available memory for field blocks.
          </t>

            endpoints MAY choose to send field blocks that exceed this limit and risk the
            request or response being treated as malformed.  This setting is specific to a
            connection, so any request or response could encounter a hop with a lower, unknown
            limit.  An intermediary can attempt to avoid this problem by passing on values presented

        <t>
          Compression can allow an attacker to recover secret data when it is compressed in the same

          (<xref target="FieldBlock"/>); the following concerns also apply to the use of HTTP
          compressed content-codings (<xref target="HTTP" section="8.4.1"/>).
        </t>
        <t>
          There are demonstrable attacks on compression that exploit the characteristics of the web
          (e.g., <xref target="BREACH"/>).  The attacker induces multiple requests containing
          varying plaintext, observing the length of the resulting ciphertext in each, which
          reveals a shorter length when a guess about the secret is correct.
        </t>

          Implementations communicating on a secure channel MUST NOT compress content that includes
          both confidential and attacker-controlled data unless separate compression dictionaries
          are used for each source of data.  Compression MUST NOT be used if the source of data

          counterproductive.  Correct application can depend on having specific knowledge of the
          data that is being padded.
        </t>
        <t>
          To mitigate attacks that rely on compression, disabling or limiting compression might be
          preferable to padding as a countermeasure.
        </t>
        <t>
          Padding can be used to obscure the exact size of frame content and is provided to
          mitigate specific attacks within HTTP, for example, attacks where compressed content
          includes both attacker-controlled plaintext and secret data (e.g., <xref target="BREACH"/>).
        </t>
        <t>
          Use of padding can result in less protection than might seem immediately obvious.  At
          best, padding only makes it more difficult for an attacker to infer length information by
          increasing the number of frames an attacker has to observe.  Incorrectly implemented
          padding schemes can be easily defeated.  In particular, randomized padding with a
          predictable distribution provides very little protection; similarly, padding frame payloads to a
          fixed size exposes information as frame payload sizes cross the fixed-sized boundary, which could
          be possible if an attacker can control plaintext.
        </t>
        <t>
          Intermediaries SHOULD retain padding for <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frames but MAY drop padding
          for <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> and <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frames.  A valid reason for an
          intermediary to change the amount of padding of frames is to improve the protections that
          padding provides.

        <name>Privacy Considerations</name>
        <t>
          Several characteristics of HTTP/2 provide an observer an opportunity to correlate actions
          of a single client or server over time.  These include the value of settings, the manner
          in which flow-control windows are managed, the way priorities are allocated to streams,
          the timing of reactions to stimulus, and the handling of any features that are controlled by
          settings.
        </t>
        <t>
          As far as these create observable differences in behavior, they could be used as a basis
          for fingerprinting a specific client, as defined in <xref target="PRIVACY" section="3.2"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          HTTP/2's preference for using a single TCP connection allows correlation of a user's
          activity on a site.  Reusing connections for different origins allows tracking
          across those origins.
        </t>
        <t>
          Because the PING and SETTINGS frames solicit immediate responses, they can be used by an
          endpoint to measure latency to their peer.  This might have privacy implications in
          certain scenarios.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Remote Timing Attacks</name>
        <t>
          Remote timing attacks extract secrets from servers by observing variations in the time
          that servers take when processing requests that use secrets. HTTP/2 enables concurrent
          request creation and processing, which can give attackers better control over when request
          processing commences.  Multiple HTTP/2 requests can be included in the same IP packet or
          TLS record.  HTTP/2 can therefore make remote timing attacks more efficient by eliminating
          variability in request delivery, leaving only request order and the delivery of responses
          as sources of timing variability.
        </t>
        <t>
          Ensuring that processing time is not dependent on the value of secrets is the best defense
          against any form of timing attack.

      <aside><t>Note: This list was assembled from the set of registered TLS cipher suites when
      <xref target="RFC7540"/> was developed.  This list includes those cipher suites that do not
      offer an ephemeral key exchange and those that are based on the TLS null, stream, or block
      cipher type (as defined in <xref target="TLS12" section="6.2.3"/>).  Additional cipher suites

      <name>Changes from RFC 7540</name>
      <t>
        This revision includes a number of editorial updates, plus the following substantive changes:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          Use of TLS 1.3 is defined based on RFC 8740, which this document obsoletes.
        </li>
        <li>
          The priority scheme defined in RFC 7540 is deprecated.  Definitions for the format of the
          <xref target="PRIORITY" format="none">PRIORITY</xref> frame and the priority fields in the
          <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> frame have been retained, plus the
          rules governing when <xref target="PRIORITY" format="none">PRIORITY</xref> frames can be
          sent and received, but the semantics of these fields are only described in RFC 7540.  The
          priority signaling scheme from RFC 7540 was not successful.  Using the simpler <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-priority">successor signaling</xref> is recommended.
        </li>
        <li>
          The HTTP/1.1 Upgrade mechanism is no longer specified in this document. It was never widely deployed,
          with plaintext HTTP/2 users choosing to use the prior-knowledge implementation instead.
        </li>
        <li>
          Validation for field names and values has been narrowed.  The validation that is mandatory
          for intermediaries is precisely defined and error reporting for requests has been amended
          to encourage sending 400-series status codes.
        </li>
        <li>
          The ranges of codepoints for settings and frame types that were reserved for "Experimental
          Use" are now available for general use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Connection-specific header fields - which are prohibited - are more precisely and
          comprehensively identified.
        </li>
        <li>
          <tt>Host</tt> and <tt>:authority</tt> are no longer permitted to disagree.
        </li>

      <t>
        Credit for non-trivial input to this document is owed to a large number of people who have
        contributed to the HTTP working group over the years.  <xref target="RFC7540"/> contains a
        more extensive list of people that deserve acknowledgment for their contributions.</t>
