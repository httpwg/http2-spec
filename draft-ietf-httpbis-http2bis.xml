        This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics of the Hypertext
        Transfer Protocol (HTTP), referred to as HTTP version 2 (HTTP/2). HTTP/2 enables a more
        efficient use of network resources and a
        reduced perception of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple
        concurrent exchanges on the same connection. It also introduces unsolicited push of
        representations from servers to clients.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message syntax.
        HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
        The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a wildly successful protocol. However, the way
        HTTP/1.1 uses the underlying transport (<xref target="RFC7230" section="6"/>) has several
        characteristics that have a negative overall effect on application performance today.
      </t>
      <t>
        In particular, HTTP/1.0 allowed only one request to be outstanding at a time on a given TCP <xref target="TCP"/>
        connection. HTTP/1.1 added request pipelining, but this only partially addressed request
        concurrency and still suffers from head-of-line blocking. Therefore, HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1
        clients that need to make many requests use multiple connections to a server in order to
        achieve concurrency and thereby reduce latency.
      </t>
      <t>
        Furthermore, HTTP header fields are often repetitive and verbose, causing unnecessary
        network traffic as well as causing the initial TCP congestion
        window to quickly fill. This can result in excessive latency when multiple requests are
        made on a new TCP connection.
      </t>
      <t>
        HTTP/2 addresses these issues by defining an optimized mapping of HTTP's semantics to an
        underlying connection. Specifically, it allows interleaving of request and response
        messages on the same connection and uses an efficient coding for HTTP header fields. It
        also allows prioritization of requests, letting more important requests complete more
        quickly, further improving performance.
      </t>
      <t>
        The resulting protocol is more friendly to the network because fewer TCP connections can
        be used in comparison to HTTP/1.x. This means less competition with other flows and
        longer-lived connections, which in turn lead to better utilization of available network
        capacity.
      </t>
      <t>
        Finally, HTTP/2 also enables more efficient processing of messages through use of binary
        message framing.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="Overview">
      <name>HTTP/2 Protocol Overview</name>
      <t>
        HTTP/2 provides an optimized transport for HTTP semantics.  HTTP/2 supports all of the core
        features of HTTP/1.1 but aims to be more efficient in several ways.
      </t>
      <t>
        The basic protocol unit in HTTP/2 is a <xref target="FrameHeader">frame</xref>.  Each frame
        type serves a different purpose.  For example, <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> and
        <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frames form the basis of <xref target="HttpSequence">HTTP requests and
        responses</xref>; other frame types like <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref>,
        <xref target="WINDOW_UPDATE" format="none">WINDOW_UPDATE</xref>, and <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> are used in support of other
        HTTP/2 features.
      </t>
      <t>
        Multiplexing of requests is achieved by having each HTTP request/response exchange
        associated with its own <xref target="StreamsLayer">stream</xref>. Streams are largely
        independent of each other, so a blocked or stalled request or response does not prevent
        progress on other streams.
      </t>
      <t>
        Flow control and prioritization ensure that it is possible to efficiently use multiplexed
        streams.  <xref target="FlowControl">Flow control</xref> helps to ensure that only data that
        can be used by a receiver is transmitted.  <xref target="StreamPriority">Prioritization</xref> ensures that limited resources can be directed
        to the most important streams first.
      </t>
      <t>
        HTTP/2 adds a new interaction mode whereby a server can <xref target="PushResources">push
        responses to a client</xref>.  Server push allows a server to speculatively send data to a
        client that the server anticipates the client will need, trading off some network usage
        against a potential latency gain.  The server does this by synthesizing a request, which it
        sends as a <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frame.  The server is then able to send a response to
        the synthetic request on a separate stream.
      </t>
      <t>
        Because HTTP header fields used in a connection can contain large amounts of redundant
        data, frames that contain them are <xref target="HeaderBlock">compressed</xref>. This has
        especially advantageous impact upon request sizes in the common case, allowing many
        requests to be compressed into one packet.
      </t>
      <section>
        <name>Document Organization</name>
        <t>
          The HTTP/2 specification is split into four parts:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li><xref target="starting">Starting HTTP/2</xref> covers how an HTTP/2 connection is
              initiated.
            </li>
          <li>
              The <xref target="FramingLayer">frame</xref> and <xref target="StreamsLayer">stream</xref> layers describe the way HTTP/2 frames are
              structured and formed into multiplexed streams.
            </li>
          <li><xref target="FrameTypes">Frame</xref> and <xref target="ErrorCodes">error</xref>
              definitions include details of the frame and error types used in HTTP/2.
            </li>
          <li><xref target="HTTPLayer">HTTP mappings</xref> and <xref target="HttpExtra">additional
              requirements</xref> describe how HTTP semantics are expressed using frames and
              streams.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          While some of the frame and stream layer concepts are isolated from HTTP, this
          specification does not define a completely generic frame layer. The frame and stream
          layers are tailored to the needs of the HTTP protocol and server push.

          Finally, the terms "gateway", "intermediary", "proxy", and "tunnel" are defined in
          <xref target="RFC7230" section="2.3"/>.  Intermediaries act as both client
          and server at different times.

      <t>
        An HTTP/2 connection is an application-layer protocol running on top of a TCP connection
        (<xref target="TCP"/>). The client is the TCP connection initiator.
      </t>
      <t>
        HTTP/2 uses the same "http" and "https" URI schemes used by HTTP/1.1. HTTP/2 shares the same
        default port numbers: 80 for "http" URIs and 443 for "https" URIs.  As a result,
        implementations processing requests for target resource URIs like <tt>http://example.org/foo</tt> or <tt>https://example.com/bar</tt> are required to first discover whether the
        upstream server (the immediate peer to which the client wishes to establish a connection)
        supports HTTP/2.
      </t>
      <t>
        The means by which support for HTTP/2 is determined is different for "http" and "https"
        URIs. Discovery for "http" URIs is described in <xref target="discover-http"/>.  Discovery
        for "https" URIs is described in <xref target="discover-https"/>.

      <section anchor="versioning">
        <name>HTTP/2 Version Identification</name>
        <t>
          The protocol defined in this document has two identifiers.
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>
                The string "h2" identifies the protocol where HTTP/2 uses <xref target="TLS12">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</xref>.  This identifier is used in the <xref target="TLS-ALPN">TLS application-layer protocol negotiation (ALPN) extension</xref>
                field and in any place where HTTP/2 over TLS is identified.
            </t>
            <t>
                The "h2" string is serialized into an ALPN protocol identifier as the two-octet
                sequence: 0x68, 0x32.
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>
                The string "h2c" identifies the protocol where HTTP/2 is run over cleartext TCP.
                This identifier is used in the HTTP/1.1 Upgrade header field and in any place where
                HTTP/2 over TCP is identified.
            </t>
            <t>
                The "h2c" string is reserved from the ALPN identifier space but describes a
                protocol that does not use TLS.

          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          Negotiating "h2" or "h2c" implies the use of the transport, security, framing, and message

        <t>
          A client that makes a request for an "http" URI without prior knowledge about support for
          HTTP/2 on the next hop uses the HTTP Upgrade mechanism (<xref target="RFC7230" section="6.7"/>). The client does so by making an HTTP/1.1 request that
          includes an Upgrade header field with the "h2c" token. Such an HTTP/1.1 request MUST
          include exactly one <xref target="Http2SettingsHeader">HTTP2-Settings</xref> header field.
        </t>
        <t keepWithNext="true">For example:</t>
        <artwork type="message/http; msgtype=&quot;request&quot;"><![CDATA[
  GET / HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.example.com
  Connection: Upgrade, HTTP2-Settings
  Upgrade: h2c
  HTTP2-Settings: <base64url encoding of HTTP/2 SETTINGS payload>

]]></artwork>
        <t>
          Requests that contain a payload body MUST be sent in their entirety before the client can
          send HTTP/2 frames.  This means that a large request can block the use of the connection
          until it is completely sent.
        </t>
        <t>
          If concurrency of an initial request with subsequent requests is important, an OPTIONS
          request can be used to perform the upgrade to HTTP/2, at the cost of an additional
          round trip.
        </t>
        <t>
          A server that does not support HTTP/2 can respond to the request as though the Upgrade
          header field were absent:

          A server MUST ignore an "h2" token in an Upgrade header field.  Presence of a token with
          "h2" implies HTTP/2 over TLS, which is instead negotiated as described in <xref target="discover-https"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          A server that supports HTTP/2 accepts the upgrade with a 101 (Switching Protocols)
          response.  After the empty line that terminates the 101 response, the server can begin
          sending HTTP/2 frames.  These frames MUST include a response to the request that initiated
          the upgrade.

          frame (<xref target="SETTINGS"/>). Upon receiving the 101 response, the client MUST send a

          values</xref>.  Stream 1 is implicitly "half-closed" from the client toward the server
          (see <xref target="StreamStates"/>), since the request is completed as an HTTP/1.1
          request.  After commencing the HTTP/2 connection, stream 1 is used for the response.

            that includes parameters that govern the HTTP/2 connection, provided in anticipation of

          HTTP/2 over TLS uses the "h2" protocol identifier.  The "h2c" protocol identifier MUST NOT
          be sent by a client or selected by a server; the "h2c" protocol identifier describes a
          protocol that does not use TLS.

          A client can learn that a particular server supports HTTP/2 by other means.  For example,
          <xref target="ALT-SVC"/> describes a mechanism for advertising this capability.
        </t>
        <t>
          A client MUST send the <xref target="ConnectionHeader">connection preface</xref> and
          then MAY immediately send HTTP/2 frames to such a server; servers can identify these
          connections by the presence of the connection preface. This only affects the
          establishment of HTTP/2 connections over cleartext TCP; implementations that support
          HTTP/2 over TLS MUST use <xref target="TLS-ALPN">protocol negotiation in TLS</xref>.

          Likewise, the server MUST send a <xref target="ConnectionHeader">connection preface</xref>.

          Without additional information, prior support for HTTP/2 is not a strong signal that a

          server configurations to change, for configurations to differ between instances in
          clustered servers, or for network conditions to change.

        <name>HTTP/2 Connection Preface</name>
        <t>
          In HTTP/2, each endpoint is required to send a connection preface as a final confirmation
          of the protocol in use and to establish the initial settings for the HTTP/2 connection.
          The client and server each send a different connection preface.
        </t>
        <t>
          The client connection preface starts with a sequence of 24 octets, which in hex notation
          is:
        </t>
        <artwork type="inline"><![CDATA[
  0x505249202a20485454502f322e300d0a0d0a534d0d0a0d0a
]]></artwork>
        <t>
          That is, the connection preface starts with the string <tt>PRI *
          HTTP/2.0\r\n\r\nSM\r\n\r\n</tt>. This sequence
          MUST be followed by a <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frame (<xref target="SETTINGS"/>), which
          MAY be empty. The client sends the client connection preface immediately upon receipt of
          a 101 (Switching Protocols) response (indicating a successful upgrade) or as the first
          application data octets of a TLS connection. If starting an HTTP/2 connection with prior
          knowledge of server support for the protocol, the client connection preface is sent upon
          connection establishment.
        </t>
        <aside>
          <t>Note:
            The client connection preface is selected so that a large proportion of HTTP/1.1 or
            HTTP/1.0 servers and intermediaries do not attempt to process further frames.  Note
            that this does not address the concerns raised in <xref target="TALKING"/>.
        </t>
        </aside>
        <t>
          The server connection preface consists of a potentially empty <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref>
          frame (<xref target="SETTINGS"/>) that MUST be the first frame the server sends in the
          HTTP/2 connection.
        </t>
        <t>
          The <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frames received from a peer as part of the connection preface
          MUST be acknowledged (see <xref target="SettingsSync"/>) after sending the connection
          preface.
        </t>
        <t>
          To avoid unnecessary latency, clients are permitted to send additional frames to the
          server immediately after sending the client connection preface, without waiting to receive
          the server connection preface.  It is important to note, however, that the server
          connection preface <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frame might include parameters that necessarily
          alter how a client is expected to communicate with the server. Upon receiving the
          <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frame, the client is expected to honor any parameters established.
          In some configurations, it is possible for the server to transmit <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref>
          before the client sends additional frames, providing an opportunity to avoid this issue.
        </t>
        <t>
          Clients and servers MUST treat an invalid connection preface as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type
          <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.  A <xref target="GOAWAY" format="none">GOAWAY</xref> frame (<xref target="GOAWAY"/>)
          MAY be omitted in this case, since an invalid preface indicates that the peer is not using
          HTTP/2.

          Just as in HTTP/1, a header field in HTTP/2 is a name with one or more associated values.
          Header fields are used within HTTP request and response messages as well as in server push operations
          (see <xref target="PushResources"/>).
        </t>
        <t>
          Header lists are collections of zero or more header fields.  When transmitted over a
          connection, a header list is serialized into a header block using <xref target="COMPRESSION">HTTP header compression</xref>.  The serialized header block is then
          divided into one or more octet sequences, called header block fragments, and transmitted
          within the payload of <xref target="HEADERS">HEADERS</xref>, <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE">PUSH_PROMISE</xref>, or <xref target="CONTINUATION">CONTINUATION</xref> frames.
        </t>
        <t>
          The <xref target="COOKIE">Cookie header field</xref> is treated specially by the HTTP
          mapping (see <xref target="CompressCookie"/>).
        </t>
        <t>
          A receiving endpoint reassembles the header block by concatenating its fragments and then
          decompresses the block to reconstruct the header list.
        </t>
        <t>
          A complete header block consists of either:

        <t>
          Header compression is stateful.  One compression context and one decompression context are
          used for the entire connection.  A decoding error in a header block MUST be treated as a
          <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type
          <xref target="COMPRESSION_ERROR" format="none">COMPRESSION_ERROR</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Each header block is processed as a discrete unit.
          Header blocks MUST be transmitted as a contiguous sequence of frames, with no interleaved
          frames of any other type or from any other stream.  The last frame in a sequence of
          <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> or <xref target="CONTINUATION" format="none">CONTINUATION</xref> frames has the END_HEADERS flag set.
          The last frame in a sequence of <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> or <xref target="CONTINUATION" format="none">CONTINUATION</xref>
          frames has the END_HEADERS flag set.  This allows a header block to be logically
          equivalent to a single frame.
        </t>
        <t>
          Header block fragments can only be sent as the payload of <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref>,
          <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref>, or <xref target="CONTINUATION" format="none">CONTINUATION</xref> frames because these frames
          carry data that can modify the compression context maintained by a receiver.  An endpoint

          <xref target="CONTINUATION" format="none">CONTINUATION</xref> frames needs to reassemble header blocks and perform
          decompression even if the frames are to be discarded.  A receiver MUST terminate the
          connection with a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type

          those transitions only.  In this regard, <xref target="CONTINUATION" format="none">CONTINUATION</xref> frames do not result
          in state transitions; they are effectively part of the <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> or
          <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> that they follow.  For the purpose of state transitions, the
          END_STREAM flag is processed as a separate event to the frame that bears it; a
          <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> frame with the END_STREAM flag set can cause two state transitions.
        </t>
        <t>
          Both endpoints have a subjective view of the state of a stream that could be different
          when frames are in transit.  Endpoints do not coordinate the creation of streams; they are
          created unilaterally by either endpoint.  The negative consequences of a mismatch in
          states are limited to the "closed" state after sending <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref>, where
          frames might be received for some time after closing.

          <t>
            Streams are identified with an unsigned 31-bit integer.  Streams initiated by a client
            MUST use odd-numbered stream identifiers; those initiated by the server MUST use
            even-numbered stream identifiers.  A stream identifier of zero (0x0) is used for
            connection control messages; the stream identifier of zero cannot be used to establish a
            new stream.
          </t>
          <t>
            HTTP/1.1 requests that are upgraded to HTTP/2 (see <xref target="discover-http"/>) are
            responded to with a stream identifier of one (0x1).  After the upgrade
            completes, stream 0x1 is "half-closed (local)" to the client.  Therefore, stream 0x1
            cannot be selected as a new stream identifier by a client that upgrades from HTTP/1.1.
          </t>
          <t>
            The identifier of a newly established stream MUST be numerically greater than all
            streams that the initiating endpoint has opened or reserved.  This governs streams that
            are opened using a <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> frame and streams that are reserved using
            <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref>.  An endpoint that receives an unexpected stream identifier
            MUST respond with a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of
            type <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.
          </t>
          <t>
            The first use of a new stream identifier implicitly closes all streams in the "idle"
            state that might have been initiated by that peer with a lower-valued stream identifier.
            For example, if a client sends a <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> frame on stream 7 without ever
            sending a frame on stream 5, then stream 5 transitions to the "closed" state when the
            first frame for stream 7 is sent or received.
          </t>
          <t>
            Stream identifiers cannot be reused.  Long-lived connections can result in an endpoint
            exhausting the available range of stream identifiers.  A client that is unable to
            establish a new stream identifier can establish a new connection for new streams.  A
            server that is unable to establish a new stream identifier can send a
            <xref target="GOAWAY" format="none">GOAWAY</xref> frame so that the client is forced to open a new connection for
            new streams.

            Streams that are in the "open" state or in either of the "half-closed" states count toward

            these three states count toward the limit advertised in the

            exceeded MUST treat this as a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream error</xref> of

          Using streams for multiplexing introduces contention over use of the TCP connection,
          resulting in blocked streams.  A flow-control scheme ensures that streams on the same
          connection do not destructively interfere with each other.  Flow control is used for both
          individual streams and for the connection as a whole.

            HTTP/2 stream flow control aims to allow a variety of flow-control algorithms to be
            used without requiring protocol changes. Flow control in HTTP/2 has the following
            characteristics:
          </t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
            <li>
                Flow control is specific to a connection.  Both types of flow control are between
                the endpoints of a single hop and not over the entire end-to-end path.
              </li>
            <li>
                Flow control is based on <xref target="WINDOW_UPDATE" format="none">WINDOW_UPDATE</xref> frames.  Receivers advertise how many octets
                they are prepared to receive on a stream and for the entire connection.  This is a
                credit-based scheme.
              </li>
            <li>
                Flow control is directional with overall control provided by the receiver.  A
                receiver MAY choose to set any window size that it desires for each stream and for
                the entire connection.  A sender MUST respect flow-control limits imposed by a
                receiver.  Clients, servers, and intermediaries all independently advertise their
                flow-control window as a receiver and abide by the flow-control limits set by
                their peer when sending.
              </li>
            <li>
                The initial value for the flow-control window is 65,535 octets for both new streams
                and the overall connection.
              </li>
            <li>
                The frame type determines whether flow control applies to a frame.  Of the frames
                specified in this document, only <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frames are subject to flow
                control; all other frame types do not consume space in the advertised flow-control
                window.  This ensures that important control frames are not blocked by flow control.

                frame (<xref target="WINDOW_UPDATE"/>).  This document does not stipulate how a
                receiver decides when to send this frame or the value that it sends, nor does it
                specify how a sender chooses to send packets.  Implementations are able to select

            Implementations are also responsible for managing how requests and responses are sent
            based on priority, choosing how to avoid head-of-line blocking for requests, and
            managing the creation of new streams.  Algorithm choices for these could interact with
            any flow-control algorithm.

          <t>
            Flow control is defined to protect endpoints that are operating under resource
            constraints.  For example, a proxy needs to share memory between many connections and
            also might have a slow upstream connection and a fast downstream one.  Flow-control
            addresses cases where the receiver is unable to process data on one stream yet wants to
            continue to process other streams in the same connection.
          </t>
          <t>
            Deployments that do not require this capability can advertise a flow-control window of
            the maximum size (2<sup>31</sup>-1) and can maintain this window by sending a
            <xref target="WINDOW_UPDATE" format="none">WINDOW_UPDATE</xref> frame when any data is received.  This effectively disables
            flow control for that receiver.  Conversely, a sender is always subject to the
            flow-control window advertised by the receiver.
          </t>
          <t>
            Deployments with constrained resources (for example, memory) can employ flow control to
            limit the amount of memory a peer can consume.  Note, however, that this can lead to
            suboptimal use of available network resources if flow control is enabled without
            knowledge of the bandwidth-delay product (see <xref target="RFC7323"/>).
          </t>
          <t>
            Even with full awareness of the current bandwidth-delay product, implementation of flow
            control can be difficult.  When using flow control, the receiver MUST read from the TCP
            receive buffer in a timely fashion.  Failure to do so could lead to a deadlock when
            critical frames, such as <xref target="WINDOW_UPDATE" format="none">WINDOW_UPDATE</xref>, are not read and acted upon.

        <name>Stream Priority</name>
        <t>
          A client can assign a priority for a new stream by including prioritization information in
          the <xref target="HEADERS">HEADERS frame</xref> that opens the stream.  At any other time,
          the <xref target="PRIORITY">PRIORITY frame</xref> can be used to change the priority of a
          stream.
        </t>
        <t>
          The purpose of prioritization is to allow an endpoint to express how it would prefer its
          peer to allocate resources when managing concurrent streams.  Most importantly, priority can
          be used to select streams for transmitting frames when there is limited capacity for
          sending.
        </t>
        <t>
          Streams can be prioritized by marking them as dependent on the completion of other streams
          (<xref target="pri-depend"/>).  Each dependency is assigned a relative weight, a number
          that is used to determine the relative proportion of available resources that are assigned
          to streams dependent on the same stream.
        </t>
        <!--
          Note that stream dependencies have not yet been validated in practice.  The theory
          might be fairly sound, but there are no implementations currently sending these.  If it
          turns out that they are not useful, or actively harmful, implementations will be requested
          to avoid creating stream dependencies.
        -->
        <t>
          Explicitly setting the priority for a stream is input to a prioritization process.  It
          does not guarantee any particular processing or transmission order for the stream relative
          to any other stream.  An endpoint cannot force a peer to process concurrent streams in a
          particular order using priority.  Expressing priority is therefore only a suggestion.
        </t>
        <t>
          Prioritization information can be omitted from messages.  Defaults are used prior to any
          explicit values being provided (<xref target="pri-default"/>).
        </t>
        <t>
          The information that an endpoint maintains for stream priority is separate from other
          state. Importantly, this includes <xref target="StreamStates">stream states</xref>. A
          stream in any state can have its priority changed with a PRIORITY frame. The state of a
          stream is not changed as a result of changing its priority. The number of streams for
          which state is remembered is at the discretion of an endpoint, see

            Each stream can be given an explicit dependency on another stream.  Including a
            dependency expresses a preference to allocate resources to the identified stream rather
            than to the dependent stream.

            A stream that is not dependent on any other stream is given a stream dependency of 0x0.

          </t>
          <t>
            A stream that depends on another stream is a dependent stream. The stream upon which a
            stream is dependent is a parent stream. A dependency on a stream that is not currently
            in the tree -- such as a stream in the "idle" state -- results in that stream being given
            a <xref target="pri-default">default priority</xref>.
          </t>
          <t>
            When assigning a dependency on another stream, the stream is added as a new dependency
            of the parent stream.  Dependent streams that share the same parent are not ordered with
            respect to each other.  For example, if streams B and C are dependent on stream A, and
            if stream D is created with a dependency on stream A, this results in a dependency order
            of A followed by B, C, and D in any order.

            An exclusive flag allows for the insertion of a new level of dependencies.  The

            causing other dependencies to become dependent on the exclusive stream.  In the
            previous example, if stream D is created with an exclusive dependency on stream A, this

            When a stream is removed from the dependency tree, its dependencies can be moved to
            become dependent on the parent of the closed stream.  The weights of new dependencies
            are recalculated by distributing the weight of the dependency of the closed stream
            proportionally based on the weights of its dependencies.
          </t>
          <t>
            Streams that are removed from the dependency tree cause some prioritization information
            to be lost.  Resources are shared between streams with the same parent stream, which
            means that if a stream in that set closes or becomes blocked, any spare capacity
            allocated to a stream is distributed to the immediate neighbors of the stream.  However,
            if the common dependency is removed from the tree, those streams share resources with
            streams at the next highest level.
          </t>
          <t>
            For example, assume streams A and B share a parent, and streams C and D both depend on
            stream A. Prior to the removal of stream A, if streams A and D are unable to proceed,
            then stream C receives all the resources dedicated to stream A.  If stream A is removed
            from the tree, the weight of stream A is divided between streams C and D.  If stream D
            is still unable to proceed, this results in stream C receiving a reduced proportion of
            resources.  For equal starting weights, C receives one third, rather than one half, of
            available resources.
          </t>
          <t>
            It is possible for a stream to become closed while prioritization information that
            creates a dependency on that stream is in transit.  If a stream identified in a
            dependency has no associated priority information, then the dependent stream is instead
            assigned a <xref target="pri-default">default priority</xref>.  This potentially creates
            suboptimal prioritization, since the stream could be given a priority that is different
            from what is intended.
          </t>
          <t>
            To avoid these problems, an endpoint SHOULD retain stream prioritization state for a
            period after streams become closed.  The longer state is retained, the lower the chance
            that streams are assigned incorrect or default priority values.
          </t>
          <t>
            Similarly, streams that are in the "idle" state can be assigned priority or become a
            parent of other streams.  This allows for the creation of a grouping node in the
            dependency tree, which enables more flexible expressions of priority.  Idle streams
            begin with a <xref target="pri-default">default priority</xref>.
          </t>
          <t>
            The retention of priority information for streams that are not counted toward the limit
            set by <xref target="SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS" format="none">SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS</xref> could create a large state burden
            for an endpoint.  Therefore, the amount of prioritization state that is retained MAY be
            limited.
          </t>
          <t>
            The amount of additional state an endpoint maintains for prioritization could be
            dependent on load; under high load, prioritization state can be discarded to limit
            resource commitments.  In extreme cases, an endpoint could even discard prioritization
            state for active or reserved streams. If a limit is applied, endpoints SHOULD maintain
            state for at least as many streams as allowed by their setting for
            <xref target="SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS" format="none">SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS</xref>.  Implementations SHOULD also attempt to
            retain state for streams that are in active use in the priority tree.
          </t>
          <t>
            If it has retained enough state to do so, an endpoint receiving a
            <xref target="PRIORITY" format="none">PRIORITY</xref> frame that changes the priority of a
            closed stream SHOULD alter the dependencies of the streams that depend on it.

              An error condition that renders the entire connection unusable is a connection error.
            </li>
          <li>
              An error in an individual stream is a stream error.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          A list of error codes is included in <xref target="ErrorCodes"/>.

          <t>
            A connection error is any error that prevents further processing of the frame
            layer or corrupts any connection state.
          </t>
          <t>
            An endpoint that encounters a connection error SHOULD first send a <xref target="GOAWAY" format="none">GOAWAY</xref>
            frame (<xref target="GOAWAY"/>) with the stream identifier of the last stream that it
            successfully received from its peer.  The <xref target="GOAWAY" format="none">GOAWAY</xref> frame includes an error
            code that indicates why the connection is terminating.  After sending the
            <xref target="GOAWAY" format="none">GOAWAY</xref> frame for an error condition, the endpoint MUST close the TCP
            connection.
          </t>
          <t>
            It is possible that the <xref target="GOAWAY" format="none">GOAWAY</xref> will not be reliably received by the
            receiving endpoint (<xref target="RFC7230" section="6.6"/> describes how an immediate connection close
            can result in data loss).  In the event of a connection error,
            <xref target="GOAWAY" format="none">GOAWAY</xref> only provides a best-effort attempt to communicate with the peer
            about why the connection is being terminated.
          </t>
          <t>
            An endpoint can end a connection at any time.  In particular, an endpoint MAY choose to
            treat a stream error as a connection error.  Endpoints SHOULD send a
            <xref target="GOAWAY" format="none">GOAWAY</xref> frame when ending a connection, providing that circumstances
            permit it.

            A stream error is an error related to a specific stream that does not affect processing
            of other streams.
          </t>
          <t>
            An endpoint that detects a stream error sends a <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> frame (<xref target="RST_STREAM"/>) that contains the stream identifier of the stream where the error
            occurred.  The <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> frame includes an error code that indicates the

            A <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> is the last frame that an endpoint can send on a stream.
            The peer that sends the <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> frame MUST be prepared to receive any
            frames that were sent or enqueued for sending by the remote peer.  These frames can be
            ignored, except where they modify connection state (such as the state maintained for
            <xref target="HeaderBlock">header compression</xref> or flow control).
          </t>
          <t>
            Normally, an endpoint SHOULD NOT send more than one <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> frame for
            any stream. However, an endpoint MAY send additional <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> frames if
            it receives frames on a closed stream after more than a round-trip time.  This behavior
            is permitted to deal with misbehaving implementations.
          </t>
          <t>
            To avoid looping, an endpoint MUST NOT send a <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> in response to a

        <name>Extending HTTP/2</name>
        <t>
          HTTP/2 permits extension of the protocol.  Within the limitations described in this
          section, protocol extensions can be used to provide additional services or alter
          any aspect of the protocol. Extensions are effective only within the scope of a single HTTP/2
          connection.
        </t>
        <t>
          This applies to the protocol elements defined in this document.  This does not affect the
          existing options for extending HTTP, such as defining new methods, status codes, or header
          fields.
        </t>
        <t>
          Extensions are permitted to use new <xref target="FrameHeader">frame types</xref>, new
          <xref target="SettingValues">settings</xref>, or new <xref target="ErrorCodes">error
          codes</xref>.  Registries are established for managing these extension points: <xref target="iana-frames">frame types</xref>, <xref target="iana-settings">settings</xref>, and
          <xref target="iana-errors">error codes</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Implementations MUST ignore unknown or unsupported values in all extensible protocol
          elements.  Implementations MUST discard frames that have unknown or unsupported types.
          This means that any of these extension points can be safely used by extensions without
          prior arrangement or negotiation.  However, extension frames that appear in the middle of
          a <xref target="HeaderBlock">header block</xref> are not permitted; these MUST be treated
          as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type
          <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Extensions that could change the semantics of existing protocol components MUST be
          negotiated before being used.  For example, an extension that changes the layout of the
          <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> frame cannot be used until the peer has given a positive signal
          that this is acceptable.  In this case, it could also be necessary to coordinate when the
          revised layout comes into effect.  Note that treating any frames other than
          <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frames as flow controlled is such a change in semantics and can only
          be done through negotiation.
        </t>
        <t>
          This document doesn't mandate a specific method for negotiating the use of an extension
          but notes that a <xref target="SettingValues">setting</xref> could be used for that
          purpose.  If both peers set a value that indicates willingness to use the extension, then
          the extension can be used.  If a setting is used for extension negotiation, the initial
          value MUST be defined in such a fashion that the extension is initially disabled.

    <section anchor="FrameTypes">
      <name>Frame Definitions</name>
      <t>
        This specification defines a number of frame types, each identified by a unique 8-bit type
        code. Each frame type serves a distinct purpose in the establishment and management either
        of the connection as a whole or of individual streams.
      </t>
      <t>
        The transmission of specific frame types can alter the state of a connection. If endpoints
        fail to maintain a synchronized view of the connection state, successful communication
        within the connection will no longer be possible. Therefore, it is important that endpoints
        have a shared comprehension of how the state is affected by the use any given frame.

      <section anchor="DATA">

          DATA frames (type=0x0) convey arbitrary, variable-length sequences of octets associated

          response payloads.
        </t>
        <t>
          DATA frames MAY also contain padding.  Padding can be added to DATA frames to obscure the

          <dt>Stream Dependency:</dt>
          <dd>
              A 31-bit stream identifier for the stream that this stream depends on (see <xref target="StreamPriority"/>).

          <dt>Weight:</dt>
          <dd>
              An unsigned 8-bit integer representing a priority weight for the stream (see <xref target="StreamPriority"/>).  Add one to the value to obtain a weight between 1 and 256.

          The PRIORITY frame always identifies a stream. If a PRIORITY frame is received with a
          stream identifier of 0x0, the recipient MUST respond with a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type

        <t>
          The PRIORITY frame can be sent on a stream in any state, though it cannot be sent between
          consecutive frames that comprise a single <xref target="HeaderBlock">header block</xref>.
          Note that this frame could arrive after processing or frame sending has completed, which
          would cause it to have no effect on the identified stream.  For a stream that is in the
          "half-closed (remote)" or "closed" state, this frame can only affect processing of the
          identified stream and its dependent streams; it does not affect frame transmission on that stream.
        </t>
        <t>
           The PRIORITY frame can be sent for a stream in the "idle" or "closed" state.  This
           allows for the reprioritization of a group of dependent streams by altering the priority
           of an unused or closed parent stream.

        <t>
          The SETTINGS frame (type=0x4) conveys configuration parameters that affect how endpoints
          communicate, such as preferences and constraints on peer behavior.  The SETTINGS frame is
          also used to acknowledge the receipt of those parameters.  Individually, a SETTINGS
          parameter can also be referred to as a "setting".
        </t>
        <t>
          SETTINGS parameters are not negotiated; they describe characteristics of the sending peer,
          which are used by the receiving peer. Different values for the same parameter can be
          advertised by each peer. For example, a client might set a high initial flow-control
          window, whereas a server might set a lower value to conserve resources.
        </t>
        <t>
          A SETTINGS frame MUST be sent by both endpoints at the start of a connection and MAY be
          sent at any other time by either endpoint over the lifetime of the connection.
          Implementations MUST support all of the parameters defined by this specification.
        </t>
        <t>
          Each parameter in a SETTINGS frame replaces any existing value for that parameter.
          Parameters are processed in the order in which they appear, and a receiver of a SETTINGS
          frame does not need to maintain any state other than the current value of its
          parameters. Therefore, the value of a SETTINGS parameter is the last value that is seen by
          a receiver.
        </t>
        <t>
          SETTINGS parameters are acknowledged by the receiving peer. To enable this, the SETTINGS
          frame defines the following flag:
        </t>
        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
          <dt>ACK (0x1):</dt>
          <dd>
              When set, bit 0 indicates that this frame acknowledges receipt and application of the
              peer's SETTINGS frame.  When this bit is set, the payload of the SETTINGS frame MUST
              be empty.  Receipt of a SETTINGS frame with the ACK flag set and a length field value
              other than 0 MUST be treated as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection
              error</xref> of type <xref target="FRAME_SIZE_ERROR" format="none">FRAME_SIZE_ERROR</xref>.  For more information, see <xref target="SettingsSync"/> ("<xref target="SettingsSync" format="title"/>").
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <t>
          SETTINGS frames always apply to a connection, never a single stream.  The stream
          identifier for a SETTINGS frame MUST be zero (0x0). If an endpoint receives a SETTINGS
          frame whose stream identifier field is anything other than 0x0, the endpoint MUST respond
          with a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type
          <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>
          The SETTINGS frame affects connection state.  A badly formed or incomplete SETTINGS frame
          MUST be treated as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type
          <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>
          A SETTINGS frame with a length other than a multiple of 6 octets MUST be treated as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type
          <xref target="FRAME_SIZE_ERROR" format="none">FRAME_SIZE_ERROR</xref>.

          PUSH_PROMISE frames MUST only be sent on a peer-initiated stream that is in either the
          "open" or "half-closed (remote)" state. The stream identifier of a PUSH_PROMISE frame
          indicates the stream it is associated with.  If the stream identifier field specifies the
          value 0x0, a recipient MUST respond with a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type
          <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.

        <t>
          Promised streams are not required to be used in the order they are promised.  The
          PUSH_PROMISE only reserves stream identifiers for later use.
        </t>
        <t>
          PUSH_PROMISE MUST NOT be sent if the <xref target="SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH" format="none">SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH</xref> setting of the
          peer endpoint is set to 0.  An endpoint that has set this setting and has received
          acknowledgement MUST treat the receipt of a PUSH_PROMISE frame as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type
          <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Recipients of PUSH_PROMISE frames can choose to reject promised streams by returning a
          <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> referencing the promised stream identifier back to the sender of
          the PUSH_PROMISE.
        </t>
        <t>
          A PUSH_PROMISE frame modifies the connection state in two ways.  First, the inclusion of a <xref target="HeaderBlock">header block</xref> potentially modifies the state maintained for
          header compression.  Second, PUSH_PROMISE also reserves a stream for later use, causing the
          promised stream to enter the "reserved" state.  A sender MUST NOT send a PUSH_PROMISE on a
          stream unless that stream is either "open" or "half-closed (remote)"; the sender MUST
          ensure that the promised stream is a valid choice for a <xref target="StreamIdentifiers">new stream identifier</xref> (that is, the promised stream MUST
          be in the "idle" state).
        </t>
        <t>
          Since PUSH_PROMISE reserves a stream, ignoring a PUSH_PROMISE frame causes the stream
          state to become indeterminate.  A receiver MUST treat the receipt of a PUSH_PROMISE on a
          stream that is neither "open" nor "half-closed (local)" as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type
          <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.  However, an endpoint that has sent
          <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> on the associated stream MUST handle PUSH_PROMISE frames that
          might have been created before the <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> frame is received and
          processed.
        </t>
        <t>
          A receiver MUST treat the receipt of a PUSH_PROMISE that promises an <xref target="StreamIdentifiers">illegal stream identifier</xref> as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type
          <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>. Note that an illegal stream identifier
          is an identifier for a stream that is not currently in the "idle" state.
        </t>
        <t>
          The PUSH_PROMISE frame can include padding.  Padding fields and flags are identical to

          In addition to the frame header, PING frames MUST contain 8 octets of opaque data in the payload.
          A sender can include any value it chooses and use those octets in any fashion.
        </t>
        <t>
          Receivers of a PING frame that does not include an ACK flag MUST send a PING frame with
          the ACK flag set in response, with an identical payload.  PING responses SHOULD be given
          higher priority than any other frame.
        </t>
        <t>
          The PING frame defines the following flags:

          <dt>ACK (0x1):</dt>
          <dd>
              When set, bit 0 indicates that this PING frame is a PING response.  An endpoint MUST
              set this flag in PING responses.  An endpoint MUST NOT respond to PING frames
              containing this flag.

        <t>
          PING frames are not associated with any individual stream. If a PING frame is received
          with a stream identifier field value other than 0x0, the recipient MUST respond with a

      <section anchor="GOAWAY">
        <name>GOAWAY</name>
        <t>
          The GOAWAY frame (type=0x7) is used to initiate shutdown of a connection or to signal
          serious error conditions.  GOAWAY allows an endpoint to gracefully stop accepting new
          streams while still finishing processing of previously established streams.  This enables
          administrative actions, like server maintenance.
        </t>
        <t>
          There is an inherent race condition between an endpoint starting new streams and the
          remote sending a GOAWAY frame.  To deal with this case, the GOAWAY contains the stream
          identifier of the last peer-initiated stream that was or might be processed on the
          sending endpoint in this connection.  For instance, if the server sends a GOAWAY frame,
          the identified stream is the highest-numbered stream initiated by the client.
        </t>
        <t>
          Once sent, the sender will ignore frames sent on streams initiated by the receiver if the
          stream has an identifier higher than the included last stream identifier.  Receivers of a
          GOAWAY frame MUST NOT open additional streams on the connection, although a new connection
          can be established for new streams.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the receiver of the GOAWAY has sent data on streams with a higher stream identifier
          than what is indicated in the GOAWAY frame, those streams are not or will not be
          processed.  The receiver of the GOAWAY frame can treat the streams as though they had
          never been created at all, thereby allowing those streams to be retried later on a new
          connection.
        </t>
        <t>
          Endpoints SHOULD always send a GOAWAY frame before closing a connection so that the remote
          peer can know whether a stream has been partially processed or not.  For example, if an
          HTTP client sends a POST at the same time that a server closes a connection, the client
          cannot know if the server started to process that POST request if the server does not send
          a GOAWAY frame to indicate what streams it might have acted on.
        </t>
        <t>
          An endpoint might choose to close a connection without sending a GOAWAY for misbehaving
          peers.
        </t>
        <t>
          A GOAWAY frame might not immediately precede closing of the connection; a receiver of a
          GOAWAY that has no more use for the connection SHOULD still send a GOAWAY frame before
          terminating the connection.

        </t>
        <t>
          The GOAWAY frame applies to the connection, not a specific stream.  An endpoint MUST treat
          a <xref target="GOAWAY" format="none">GOAWAY</xref> frame with a stream identifier other than 0x0 as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type

        </t>
        <t>
          The last stream identifier in the GOAWAY frame contains the highest-numbered stream
          identifier for which the sender of the GOAWAY frame might have taken some action on or
          might yet take action on.  All streams up to and including the identified stream might
          have been processed in some way.  The last stream identifier can be set to 0 if no streams
          were processed.
        </t>
        <aside>
          <t>Note:
            In this context, "processed" means that some data from the stream was passed to some

          </t>
        </aside>
        <t>
          If a connection terminates without a GOAWAY frame, the last stream identifier is
          effectively the highest possible stream identifier.

        <t>
          On streams with lower- or equal-numbered identifiers that were not closed completely prior
          to the connection being closed, reattempting requests, transactions, or any protocol
          activity is not possible, with the exception of idempotent actions like HTTP GET, PUT, or
          DELETE.  Any protocol activity that uses higher-numbered streams can be safely retried
          using a new connection.
        </t>
        <t>
          Activity on streams numbered lower or equal to the last stream identifier might still
          complete successfully.  The sender of a GOAWAY frame might gracefully shut down a
          connection by sending a GOAWAY frame, maintaining the connection in an "open" state until
          all in-progress streams complete.
        </t>
        <t>
          An endpoint MAY send multiple GOAWAY frames if circumstances change.  For instance, an
          endpoint that sends GOAWAY with <xref target="NO_ERROR" format="none">NO_ERROR</xref> during graceful shutdown could
          subsequently encounter a condition that requires immediate termination of the connection.
          The last stream identifier from the last GOAWAY frame received indicates which streams
          could have been acted upon.  Endpoints MUST NOT increase the value they send in the last
          stream identifier, since the peers might already have retried unprocessed requests on
          another connection.
        </t>
        <t>
          A client that is unable to retry requests loses all requests that are in flight when the
          server closes the connection.  This is especially true for intermediaries that might not
          be serving clients using HTTP/2.  A server that is attempting to gracefully shut down a
          connection SHOULD send an initial GOAWAY frame with the last stream identifier set to
          2<sup>31</sup>-1 and a <xref target="NO_ERROR" format="none">NO_ERROR</xref> code.  This signals to the client that
          a shutdown is imminent and that initiating further requests is prohibited.  After allowing
          time for any in-flight stream creation (at least one round-trip time),  the server can
          send another GOAWAY frame with an updated last stream identifier.  This ensures that a
          connection can be cleanly shut down without losing requests.
        </t>
        <t>
          After sending a GOAWAY frame, the sender can discard frames for streams initiated by the
          receiver with identifiers higher than the identified last stream.  However, any frames
          that alter connection state cannot be completely ignored.  For instance,
          <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref>, <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref>, and <xref target="CONTINUATION" format="none">CONTINUATION</xref> frames
          MUST be minimally processed to ensure the state maintained for header compression is
          consistent (see <xref target="HeaderBlock"/>); similarly, DATA frames MUST be counted
          toward the connection flow-control window.  Failure to process these frames can cause flow
          control or header compression state to become unsynchronized.
        </t>
        <t>
          The GOAWAY frame also contains a 32-bit <xref target="ErrorCodes">error code</xref> that
          contains the reason for closing the connection.
        </t>
        <t>
          Endpoints MAY append opaque data to the payload of any GOAWAY frame.  Additional debug
          data is intended for diagnostic purposes only and carries no semantic value.  Debug
          information could contain security- or privacy-sensitive data.  Logged or otherwise
          persistently stored debug data MUST have adequate safeguards to prevent unauthorized
          access.

          <t>
            Flow control in HTTP/2 is implemented using a window kept by each sender on every
            stream. The flow-control window is a simple integer value that indicates how many octets
            of data the sender is permitted to transmit; as such, its size is a measure of the
            buffering capacity of the receiver.
          </t>
          <t>
            Two flow-control windows are applicable: the stream flow-control window and the
            connection flow-control window.  The sender MUST NOT send a flow-controlled frame with a
            length that exceeds the space available in either of the flow-control windows advertised
            by the receiver.  Frames with zero length with the END_STREAM flag set (that is, an
            empty <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frame) MAY be sent if there is no available space in either
            flow-control window.
          </t>
          <t>
            For flow-control calculations, the 9-octet frame header is not counted.
          </t>
          <t>
            After sending a flow-controlled frame, the sender reduces the space available in both
            windows by the length of the transmitted frame.
          </t>
          <t>
            The receiver of a frame sends a WINDOW_UPDATE frame as it consumes data and frees up
            space in flow-control windows.  Separate WINDOW_UPDATE frames are sent for the stream-
            and connection-level flow-control windows.
          </t>
          <t>
            A sender that receives a WINDOW_UPDATE frame updates the corresponding window by the
            amount specified in the frame.
          </t>
          <t>
            A sender MUST NOT allow a flow-control window to exceed 2<sup>31</sup>-1 octets.
            If a sender receives a WINDOW_UPDATE that causes a flow-control window to exceed this
            maximum, it MUST terminate either the stream or the connection, as appropriate.  For
            streams, the sender sends a <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> with an error code of
            <xref target="FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR" format="none">FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR</xref>; for the connection, a <xref target="GOAWAY" format="none">GOAWAY</xref>
            frame with an error code of <xref target="FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR" format="none">FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR</xref> is sent.
          </t>
          <t>
            Flow-controlled frames from the sender and WINDOW_UPDATE frames from the receiver are
            completely asynchronous with respect to each other. This property allows a receiver to
            aggressively update the window size kept by the sender to prevent streams from stalling.

            octets. Both endpoints can adjust the initial window size for new streams by including
            a value for <xref target="SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE" format="none">SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</xref> in the <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref>
            frame that forms part of the connection preface. The connection flow-control window can
            only be changed using WINDOW_UPDATE frames.
          </t>
          <t>
            Prior to receiving a <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frame that sets a value for
            <xref target="SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE" format="none">SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</xref>, an endpoint can only use the default
            initial window size when sending flow-controlled frames.  Similarly, the connection flow-control
            window is set to the default initial window size until a WINDOW_UPDATE frame is
            received.
          </t>
          <t>
            In addition to changing the flow-control window for streams that are not yet active, a
            <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frame can alter the initial flow-control window size for streams
            with active flow-control windows (that is, streams in the "open" or "half-closed
            (remote)" state).  When the value of <xref target="SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE" format="none">SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</xref>
            changes, a receiver MUST adjust the size of all stream flow-control windows that it
            maintains by the difference between the new value and the old value.
          </t>
          <t>
            A change to <xref target="SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE" format="none">SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</xref> can cause the available space in
            a flow-control window to become negative.  A sender MUST track the negative flow-control
            window and MUST NOT send new flow-controlled frames until it receives WINDOW_UPDATE
            frames that cause the flow-control window to become positive.
          </t>
          <t>
            For example, if the client sends 60 KB immediately on connection establishment and the
            server sets the initial window size to be 16 KB, the client will recalculate the
            available flow-control window to be -44 KB on receipt of the <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref>
            frame.  The client retains a negative flow-control window until WINDOW_UPDATE frames
            restore the window to being positive, after which the client can resume sending.
          </t>
          <t>
            A <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frame cannot alter the connection flow-control window.
          </t>
          <t>
            An endpoint MUST treat a change to <xref target="SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE" format="none">SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</xref> that
            causes any flow-control window to exceed the maximum size as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type

            A receiver that wishes to use a smaller flow-control window than the current size can
            send a new <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frame.  However, the receiver MUST be prepared to
            receive data that exceeds this window size, since the sender might send data that
            exceeds the lower limit prior to processing the <xref target="SETTINGS" format="none">SETTINGS</xref> frame.
          </t>
          <t>
            After sending a SETTINGS frame that reduces the initial flow-control window size, a
            receiver MAY continue to process streams that exceed flow-control limits.  Allowing
            streams to continue does not allow the receiver to immediately reduce the space it
            reserves for flow-control windows.  Progress on these streams can also stall, since
            <xref target="WINDOW_UPDATE" format="none">WINDOW_UPDATE</xref> frames are needed to allow the sender to resume sending.
            The receiver MAY instead send a <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> with an error code of
            <xref target="FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR" format="none">FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR</xref> for the affected streams.

        HTTP/2 is intended to be as compatible as possible with current uses of HTTP. This means

              This means that an intermediary transforming an HTTP/1.x message to HTTP/2 will need
              to remove any header fields nominated by the Connection header field, along with the
              Connection header field itself. Such intermediaries SHOULD also remove other
              connection-specific header fields, such as Keep-Alive, Proxy-Connection,
              Transfer-Encoding, and Upgrade, even if they are not nominated by the Connection header field.

                </t>
                <t><tt>:scheme</tt> is not restricted to <tt>http</tt> and <tt>https</tt> schemed URIs.  A
                    proxy or gateway can translate requests for non-HTTP schemes, enabling the use
                    of HTTP to interact with non-HTTP services.

                    A request in asterisk form includes the value '*' for the

              To allow for better compression efficiency, the Cookie header field MAY be split into

              before being passed into a non-HTTP/2 context, such as an HTTP/1.1 connection, or a

            <t>
              A malformed request or response is one that is an otherwise valid sequence of HTTP/2
              frames but is invalid due to the presence of extraneous frames, prohibited
              header fields, the absence of mandatory header fields, or the inclusion of uppercase
              header field names.
            </t>
            <t>
              A request or response that includes a payload body can include a <tt>content-length</tt> header field.  A request or response is also
              malformed if the value of a <tt>content-length</tt> header field
              does not equal the sum of the <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frame payload lengths that form the
              body.  A response that is defined to have no payload, as described in <xref target="RFC7230"/>, can have a non-zero
              <tt>content-length</tt> header field, even though no content is
              included in <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frames.

            <t>
              Intermediaries that process HTTP requests or responses (i.e., any intermediary not
              acting as a tunnel) MUST NOT forward a malformed request or response.  Malformed
              requests or responses that are detected MUST be treated as a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream error</xref> of type <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.

            <t>
              For malformed requests, a server MAY send an HTTP response prior to closing or
              resetting the stream.  Clients MUST NOT accept a malformed response. Note that these
              requirements are intended to protect against several types of common attacks against
              HTTP; they are deliberately strict because being permissive can expose

            In HTTP/1.1, an HTTP client is unable to retry a non-idempotent request when an error
            occurs because there is no means to determine the nature of the error.  It is possible
            that some server processing occurred prior to the error, which could result in
            undesirable effects if the request were reattempted.
          </t>
          <t>
            HTTP/2 provides two mechanisms for providing a guarantee to a client that a request has
            not been processed:
          </t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
                The <xref target="GOAWAY" format="none">GOAWAY</xref> frame indicates the highest stream number that might have
                been processed.  Requests on streams with higher numbers are therefore guaranteed to
                be safe to retry.
              </li>
            <li>
                The <xref target="REFUSED_STREAM" format="none">REFUSED_STREAM</xref> error code can be included in a
                <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref> frame to indicate that the stream is being closed prior to
                any processing having occurred.  Any request that was sent on the reset stream can
                be safely retried.
              </li>
          </ul>
          <t>
            Requests that have not been processed have not failed; clients MAY automatically retry
            them, even those with non-idempotent methods.
          </t>
          <t>
            A server MUST NOT indicate that a stream has not been processed unless it can guarantee
            that fact.  If frames that are on a stream are passed to the application layer for any
            stream, then <xref target="REFUSED_STREAM" format="none">REFUSED_STREAM</xref> MUST NOT be used for that stream, and a
            <xref target="GOAWAY" format="none">GOAWAY</xref> frame MUST include a stream identifier that is greater than or
            equal to the given stream identifier.
          </t>
          <t>
            In addition to these mechanisms, the <xref target="PING" format="none">PING</xref> frame provides a way for a
            client to easily test a connection.  Connections that remain idle can become broken as
            some middleboxes (for instance, network address translators or load balancers) silently
            discard connection bindings.  The <xref target="PING" format="none">PING</xref> frame allows a client to safely
            test whether a connection is still active without sending a request.

      <section anchor="PushResources">
        <name>Server Push</name>
        <t>
          HTTP/2 allows a server to pre-emptively send (or "push") responses (along with
          corresponding "promised" requests) to a client in association with a previous
          client-initiated request. This can be useful when the server knows the client will need
          to have those responses available in order to fully process the response to the original
          request.
        </t>
        <t>
          A client can request that server push be disabled, though this is negotiated for each hop
          independently. The <xref target="SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH" format="none">SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH</xref> setting can be set to 0 to indicate
          that server push is disabled.
        </t>
        <t>
          Promised requests MUST be cacheable (see <xref target="RFC7231" section="4.2.3"/>), MUST be safe
          (see <xref target="RFC7231" section="4.2.1"/>), and MUST NOT include a request body. Clients that receive a
          promised request that is not cacheable, that is not known to be safe, or that indicates the
          presence of a request body MUST reset the promised stream with a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream error</xref> of type <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.
          Note this could result in the promised stream being reset if the client does not recognize
          a newly defined method as being safe.
        </t>
        <t>
          Pushed responses that are cacheable (see <xref target="RFC7234" section="3"/>) can be stored by the client, if it implements an HTTP
          cache.  Pushed responses are considered successfully validated on the origin server (e.g.,
          if the "no-cache" cache response directive is present; see <xref target="RFC7234" section="5.2.2"/>) while the stream identified by the
          promised stream ID is still open.
        </t>
        <t>
          Pushed responses that are not cacheable MUST NOT be stored by any HTTP cache. They MAY
          be made available to the application separately.
        </t>
        <t>
          The server MUST include a value in the <tt>:authority</tt> pseudo-header field
          for which the server is authoritative (see <xref target="authority"/>).  A client MUST
          treat a <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> for which the server is not authoritative as a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream error</xref> of type <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>
          An intermediary can receive pushes from the server and choose not to forward them on to
          the client. In other words, how to make use of the pushed information is up to that
          intermediary. Equally, the intermediary might choose to make additional pushes to the
          client, without any action taken by the server.
        </t>
        <t>
          A client cannot push. Thus, servers MUST treat the receipt of a
          <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frame as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection
          error</xref> of type <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>. Clients MUST reject any attempt to
          change the <xref target="SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH" format="none">SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH</xref> setting to a value other than 0 by treating
          the message as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type

            Server push is semantically equivalent to a server responding to a request; however, in
            this case, that request is also sent by the server, as a <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref>

          <t>
            The <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frame includes a header block that contains a complete
            set of request header fields that the server attributes to the request. It is not
            possible to push a response to a request that includes a request body.
          </t>
          <t>
            Promised requests are always associated with an explicit request from the client. The

            the <tt>:method</tt> pseudo-header field that is safe and cacheable.  If a
            client receives a <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> that does not include a complete and valid
            set of header fields or the <tt>:method</tt> pseudo-header field identifies
            a method that is not safe, it MUST respond with a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream error</xref> of type <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.
          </t>
          <t>
            The server SHOULD send <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> (<xref target="PUSH_PROMISE"/>)
            frames prior to sending any frames that reference the promised responses. This avoids a
            race where clients issue requests prior to receiving any <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref>
            frames.
          </t>

            For example, if the server receives a request for a document containing embedded links

            image links ensures that the client is able to see that a resource will be pushed
            before discovering embedded links. Similarly, if the server pushes responses referenced by the header block
            (for instance, in Link header fields), sending a <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> before sending the

            Once a client receives a <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frame and chooses to accept the

            preventing the server from creating the necessary streams.  This does not prohibit a

          In HTTP/1.x, the pseudo-method CONNECT (<xref target="RFC7231" section="4.3.6"/>) is
          used to convert an HTTP connection into a tunnel to a remote host.
          CONNECT is primarily used with HTTP proxies to establish a TLS session with an origin
          server for the purposes of interacting with <tt>https</tt> resources.
        </t>
        <t>
          In HTTP/2, the CONNECT method is used to establish a tunnel over a single HTTP/2 stream to
          a remote host for similar purposes. The HTTP header field mapping works as defined in
          <xref target="HttpRequest"/> ("<xref target="HttpRequest" format="title"/>"), with a few
          differences. Specifically:

            </li>
          <li>
              The <tt>:authority</tt> pseudo-header field contains the host and port to
              connect to (equivalent to the authority-form of the request-target of CONNECT
              requests (see <xref target="RFC7230" section="5.3"/>)).
            </li>

          frame containing a 2xx series status code to the client, as defined in <xref target="RFC7231" section="4.3.6"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          After the initial <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> frame sent by each peer, all subsequent

          any <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frames sent by the client is transmitted by the proxy to the TCP
          server; data received from the TCP server is assembled into <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frames by

          The TCP connection can be closed by either peer.  The END_STREAM flag on a

          expected to send a <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frame with the END_STREAM flag set after receiving
          a frame bearing the END_STREAM flag.  A proxy that receives a <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frame
          with the END_STREAM flag set sends the attached data with the FIN bit set on the last TCP
          segment.  A proxy that receives a TCP segment with the FIN bit set sends a
          <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frame with the END_STREAM flag set.  Note that the final TCP segment
          or <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frame could be empty.
        </t>
        <t>
          A TCP connection error is signaled with <xref target="RST_STREAM" format="none">RST_STREAM</xref>.  A proxy treats any

          as a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream error</xref> of type
          <xref target="CONNECT_ERROR" format="none">CONNECT_ERROR</xref>.  Correspondingly, a proxy MUST send a TCP segment with the

          A client MAY open multiple connections to the same IP address and TCP port using different

            In some deployments, reusing a connection for multiple origins can result in requests
            being directed to the wrong origin server.  For example, TLS termination might be
            performed by a middlebox that uses the TLS <xref target="TLS-EXT">Server Name Indication
            (SNI)</xref> extension to select an origin server.  This means that it is possible
            for clients to send confidential information to servers that might not be the intended
            target for the request, even though the server is otherwise authoritative.
          </t>
          <t>
            A server that does not wish clients to reuse connections can indicate that it is not
            authoritative for a request by sending a 421 (Misdirected Request) status code in response
            to the request (see <xref target="MisdirectedRequest"/>).

            A client that is configured to use a proxy over HTTP/2 directs requests to that proxy
            through a single connection.  That is, all requests sent via a proxy reuse the

            The 421 (Misdirected Request) status code indicates that the request was directed at a
            server that is not able to produce a response.  This can be sent by a server that is not
            configured to produce responses for the combination of scheme and authority that are
            included in the request URI.
          </t>
          <t>
            Clients receiving a 421 (Misdirected Request) response from a server MAY retry the
            request -- whether the request method is idempotent or not -- over a different connection.
            This is possible if a connection is reused (<xref target="reuse"/>) or if an alternative
            service is selected <xref target="ALT-SVC"/>.

            A 421 response is cacheable by default, i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method
            definition or explicit cache controls (see <xref target="RFC7234" section="4.2.2"/>).  However, it is
            likely that caching is not desirable as a 421 response is connection-specific, which
            is not part of a cache key.  421 responses SHOULD therefore be marked as uncacheable.

          Deployments of HTTP/2 that negotiate TLS 1.3 or higher need only support and use the SNI

            This section describes restrictions on the TLS 1.2 feature set that can be used with
            HTTP/2.  Due to deployment limitations, it might not be possible to fail TLS negotiation
            when these restrictions are not met.  An endpoint MAY immediately terminate an HTTP/2
            connection that does not meet these TLS requirements with a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type

            A deployment of HTTP/2 over TLS 1.2 MUST disable compression.  TLS compression can lead
            to the exposure of information that would not otherwise be revealed <xref target="RFC3749"/>.  Generic compression is unnecessary since HTTP/2 provides
            compression features that are more aware of context and therefore likely to be more
            appropriate for use for performance, security, or other reasons.
          </t>
          <t>
            A deployment of HTTP/2 over TLS 1.2 MUST disable renegotiation.  An endpoint MUST treat
            a TLS renegotiation as a <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref>
            of type <xref target="PROTOCOL_ERROR" format="none">PROTOCOL_ERROR</xref>.  Note that disabling renegotiation can result in
            long-lived connections becoming unusable due to limits on the number of messages the

          </t>
          <t>
            An endpoint MAY use renegotiation to provide confidentiality protection for client
            credentials offered in the handshake, but any renegotiation MUST occur prior to sending
            the connection preface.  A server SHOULD request a client certificate if it sees a
            renegotiation request immediately after establishing a connection.
          </t>
          <t>
            This effectively prevents the use of renegotiation in response to a request for a
            specific protected resource.  A future specification might provide a way to support this
            use case. Alternatively, a server might use an <xref target="ErrorHandler">

            Implementations MUST NOT generate this error in reaction to the negotiation of a cipher
            suite that is not prohibited.  Consequently, when clients offer a cipher suite
            that is not prohibited, they have to be prepared to use that cipher suite with
            HTTP/2.

            The list of prohibited cipher suites includes the cipher suite that TLS 1.2 makes mandatory,
            which means that TLS 1.2 deployments could have non-intersecting sets of permitted cipher
            suites.  To avoid this problem causing TLS handshake failures, deployments of HTTP/2 that use
            TLS 1.2 MUST support TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 <xref target="TLS-ECDHE"/> with
            the P-256 elliptic curve <xref target="FIPS186"/>.

            Note that clients might advertise support of cipher suites that are prohibited in

            servers to select HTTP/1.1 with a cipher suite that is prohibited in HTTP/2.
            However, this can result in HTTP/2 being negotiated with a prohibited cipher suite if
            the application protocol and cipher suite are independently selected.

        <t>
          In a cross-protocol attack, an attacker causes a client to initiate a transaction in one
          protocol toward a server that understands a different protocol.  An attacker might be able
          to cause the transaction to appear as a valid transaction in the second protocol.  In
          combination with the capabilities of the web context, this can be used to interact with
          poorly protected servers in private networks.
        </t>
        <t>
          Completing a TLS handshake with an ALPN identifier for HTTP/2 can be considered sufficient
          protection against cross-protocol attacks.  ALPN provides a positive indication that a
          server is willing to proceed with HTTP/2, which prevents attacks on other TLS-based
          protocols.
        </t>
        <t>
          The encryption in TLS makes it difficult for attackers to control the data that could be
          used in a cross-protocol attack on a cleartext protocol.
        </t>
        <t>
          The cleartext version of HTTP/2 has minimal protection against cross-protocol attacks.
          The <xref target="ConnectionHeader">connection preface</xref> contains a string that is
          designed to confuse HTTP/1.1 servers, but no special protection is offered for other
          protocols.  A server that is willing to ignore parts of an HTTP/1.1 request containing an
          Upgrade header field in addition to the client connection preface could be exposed to a
          cross-protocol attack.

        <name>Intermediary Encapsulation Attacks</name>
        <t>
          The HTTP/2 header field encoding allows the expression of names that are not valid field
          names in the Internet Message Syntax used by HTTP/1.1.  Requests or responses containing
          invalid header field names MUST be treated as <xref target="malformed">malformed</xref>.
          An intermediary therefore cannot translate an HTTP/2 request or response containing an
          invalid field name into an HTTP/1.1 message.

        <t>
          Similarly, HTTP/2 allows header field values that are not valid.  While most of the values
          that can be encoded will not alter header field parsing, carriage return (CR, ASCII 0xd),
          line feed (LF, ASCII 0xa), and the zero character (NUL, ASCII 0x0) might be exploited by
          an attacker if they are translated verbatim.  Any request or response that contains a
          character not permitted in a header field value MUST be treated as <xref target="malformed">malformed</xref>.  Valid characters are defined by the <tt>field-content</tt> ABNF rule in <xref target="RFC7230" section="3.2"/>.

        </t>
        <t>
          Caching responses that are pushed is possible based on the guidance provided by the origin
          server in the Cache-Control header field.  However, this can cause issues if a single
          server hosts more than one tenant.  For example, a server might offer multiple users each

          Where multiple tenants share space on the same server, that server MUST ensure that

        <t>
          There are demonstrable attacks on compression that exploit the characteristics of the web
          (e.g., <xref target="BREACH"/>).  The attacker induces multiple requests containing
          varying plaintext, observing the length of the resulting ciphertext in each, which
          reveals a shorter length when a guess about the secret is correct.

          Implementations communicating on a secure channel MUST NOT compress content that includes

          Use of padding can result in less protection than might seem immediately obvious.  At
          best, padding only makes it more difficult for an attacker to infer length information by
          increasing the number of frames an attacker has to observe.  Incorrectly implemented
          padding schemes can be easily defeated.  In particular, randomized padding with a
          predictable distribution provides very little protection; similarly, padding payloads to a
          fixed size exposes information as payload sizes cross the fixed-sized boundary, which could
          be possible if an attacker can control plaintext.
        </t>
        <t>
          Intermediaries SHOULD retain padding for <xref target="DATA" format="none">DATA</xref> frames but MAY drop padding
          for <xref target="HEADERS" format="none">HEADERS</xref> and <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE" format="none">PUSH_PROMISE</xref> frames.  A valid reason for an
          intermediary to change the amount of padding of frames is to improve the protections that
          padding provides.

          Several characteristics of HTTP/2 provide an observer an opportunity to correlate actions
          of a single client or server over time.  These include the value of settings, the manner
          in which flow-control windows are managed, the way priorities are allocated to streams,
          the timing of reactions to stimulus, and the handling of any features that are controlled by
          settings.
        </t>
        <t>
          As far as these create observable differences in behavior, they could be used as a basis
          for fingerprinting a specific client, as defined in
          <xref target="HTML5" section="1.8" relative="#fingerprint"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          HTTP/2's preference for using a single TCP connection allows correlation of a user's
          activity on a site.  Reusing connections for different origins allows tracking
          across those origins.
        </t>
        <t>
          Because the PING and SETTINGS frames solicit immediate responses, they can be used by an
          endpoint to measure latency to their peer.  This might have privacy implications in
          certain scenarios.

        <t>Note:
          This list was assembled from the set of registered TLS cipher suites at the time of
          writing.  This list includes those cipher suites that do not offer an ephemeral key
          exchange and those that are based on the TLS null, stream, or block cipher type (as
          defined in <xref target="TLS12" section="6.2.3"/>).  Additional cipher suites with
          these properties could be defined; these would not be explicitly prohibited.
