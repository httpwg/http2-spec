      <t>This document proposes a way to optimistically encrypt HTTP/2.0 using TLS for
HTTP URIs.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>
  <middle>
    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>In discussion at IETF87, it was proposed that the current means of
bootstrapping encryption in HTTP <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging"/> – using the
“HTTPS” URI scheme – unintentionally gives the server disproportionate power
in determining whether encryption is used.</t>
      <t>Furthermore, HTTP’s current use of TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/> for “https://” URIs is
inflexible; it is difficult to introduce new trust roots, for example.</t>
      <t>This document uses the new “alternate services” layer described in
<xref target="I-D.nottingham-httpbis-alt-svc"/> to decouple the URI scheme from the use and
configuration of underlying encryption, allowing a “http://” URI to be upgraded
to use TLS optimistically.</t>
      <t>Additionally, because using TLS requires acquiring and configuring a valid
certificate, some deployments may find supporting it difficult. Therefore, this
document also specifies a “relaxed” profile of HTTP/2.0 over TLS that does not
require strong server authentication, specifically for use with “http://” URIs.</t>
      <section anchor="goals-and-non-goals" title="Goals and Non-Goals">
        <t>The immediate goal is to make HTTP URIs more robust in the face of passive
monitoring.</t>
        <t>Such passive attacks are often opportunistic; they rely on sensitive
information being available in the clear. Furthermore, they are often broad,
where all available data is collected en masse, being analyzed separately for
relevant information.</t>
        <t>It is not a goal of this document to address active or targeted attacks,
although future solutions may be complementary.</t>
        <t>Other goals include ease of implementation and deployment, with minimal impact
upon performance (in keeping with the goals of HTTP/2.0).</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="notational-conventions" title="Notational Conventions">
        <t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="protocol-identifiers-for-http-security" title="Protocol Identifiers for HTTP Security">
      <t>In past dicussions, there has been general agreement to reusing the ALPN
protocol identifier <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-applayerprotoneg"/> for all negotiation
mechanisms in HTTP/2.0, not just TLS.</t>
      <t>This document proposes putting additional information into them to identify the
use of encryption as well as configuration of that encryption, independent of
the URI scheme in use.</t>
      <t>Thus, we won’t have just one protocol identifier for HTTP/2.0, but two; one
with and one without the use of TLS. For example, the following identifiers
might be registered if this approach is adopted:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>http1 - http/1.x over TCP</t>
          <t>http1-tls - http/1.x over TLS over TCP (as per <xref target="RFC2818"/>)</t>
          <t>http2 - http/2.x over TCP</t>
          <t>http2-tls - http/2.x over TLS over TCP (as per <xref target="RFC2818"/>)</t>
          <t>http2-tls-relaxed - http/2.x over TLS over TCP (see <xref target="relaxed"/>)</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Most of these are already latently defined by HTTP/2.0, with the exception
being http2-tls-relaxed, defined below. By indicating the use of TLS in the
protocol identifier allows a client and server to negotiate the use of TLS for
“http://” URIs; if the server offers http2-tls, the client can select that
protocol, start TLS and use it.</t>
      <t>Note that, as discussed in <xref target="downgrade"/>, there may be situations (e.g,. ALPN)
where advertising some of these profiles are inapplicable or inadvisable.</t>
      <t>For example, in an ALPN negotiation for a “https://” URI, it is only sensible
to offer http1-tls and http2-tls. </t>
      <section anchor="relaxed" title="The “http2-tls-relaxed” Protocol">
        <t>Servers that support the “http2-tls-relaxed” protocol indicate that they
support TLS for access to URIs with the “http” URI scheme using HTTP/2.0 or
greater.</t>
        <t>Servers MAY advertise the “http2-tls-relaxed” profile for resources with a
“http” origin scheme; they MUST NOT advertise it for resources with a “https”
origin.</t>
        <t>When a client connects to an “http2-tls-relaxed” alternate service, it MUST use
TLS1.1 or greater, and MUST use HTTP/2.x. HTTP/2.0 SHOULD be used as
soon as TLS negotiation is completed; i.e., the “Upgrade dance” SHOULD NOT be
performed.</t>
        <t>When connecting to an “http2-tls-relaxed” service, the algorithm for
authenticating the server described in <xref target="RFC2818"/> Section 3.1 changes; the
client does not necessarily validate its certificate for expiry, hostname match
or relationship to a known certificate authority (as it would with “normal”
HTTPS).</t>
        <t>However, the client MAY perform additional checks on the certificate and make a
decision as to its validity before using the server. Definition of such
additional checks are out of scope for this specification.</t>
        <t>Upon initial adoption of this proposal, it is expected that no such additional
checks will be performed. Therefore, the client MUST NOT use the
“http2-tls-relaxed” profile to connect to alternate services whose host does
not match that of the origin, unless additional checks are performed.</t>
        <t>This requirement bounds the risk of a service being hijacked and redirected to
another host; see Security Considerations for details.</t>
        <t>[[TODO: define “match”]]</t>
        <t>Servers SHOULD use the same certificate consistently over time, to aid future
extensions for building trust and adding other services.</t>
        <t>[[TODO: define “same”; likely not the same actual certificate. ]]</t>
        <t>When the http2-tls-relaxed protocol is in use, User Agents MUST NOT indicate
the connection has the same level of security as https:// (e.g. using a “lock
device”).</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">
      <section anchor="downgrade" title="Downgrade Attacks">
        <t>A downgrade attack against the negotation for TLS is possible, depending upon
the properties of the negotiation mechanism.</t>
        <t>For example, because the Alt-Svc header field <xref target="I-D.nottingham-httpbis-alt-svc"/>
appears in the clear for “http://” URIs, it is subject to downgrade by
attackers that are able to Man-in-the-Middle the network connection; in its
simplest form, an attacker that wants the connection to remain in the clear
need only strip the Alt-Svc header from responses.</t>
        <t>This proposal does not offer a remedy for this risk. However, it’s important to
note that it is no worse than current use of unencrypted HTTP in the face of
such active attacks.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="alt-svc-header-field-gap" title="Alt-Svc Header Field “Gap”">
        <t>When the Alt-Svc header field is used in “http://” URIs, the client needs to
send an unencrypted HTTP request to the server to discover the alternates. In
doing so, it potentially exposes sensitive information (e.g., cookies
<xref target="RFC6265"/>) to surveillance.</t>
        <t>This risk can be mitigated if the client is willing to send a separate request
(e.g., OPTIONS *) to the origin to discover policy before making requests
containing potentially sensitive information. However, doing so adds a
round-trip of latency to such requests.</t>
        <t>Likewise, if the Alt-Svc is cacheable for a long period (using a large ma
parameter), it reduces the window for such attacks (but does not eliminate it).</t>
        <t>Alternatively, this risk can be mitigated by using an out-of-band discovery
mechanism (e.g., DNS).</t>

            <t>This specification describes an optimized expression of the syntax of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  The HTTP/2.0 encapsulation enables more efficient use of network resources and reduced perception of latency by allowing header field compression and multiple concurrent messages on the same connection.  It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients.  This document is an alternative to, but does not obsolete the HTTP/1.1 message format or protocol.  HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.  This version of the draft has been marked for implementation. Interoperability testing will occur in the HTTP/2.0 interim in Seatle, US, starting 2013-10-09.</t>

            <t>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields.  These header fields can be used by HTTP servers to store state (called cookies) at HTTP user agents, letting the servers maintain a stateful session over the mostly stateless HTTP protocol.  Although cookies have many historical infelicities that degrade their security and privacy, the Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields are widely used on the Internet.  This document obsoletes RFC 2965.

            <t>This document offers guidance for developing privacy considerations for inclusion in protocol specifications.  It aims to make designers, implementers, and users of Internet protocols aware of privacy-related design choices.  It suggests that whether any individual RFC warrants a specific privacy considerations section will depend on the document's content.</t>

      <t>One of the design goals for SPDY <xref target="I-D.mbelshe-httpbis-spdy"/> was increasing
the use of encryption on the Web, achieved by only supporting the protocol over
a connection protected by TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/>.</t>
      <t>This was done, in part, because sensitive information – including not only
login credentials, but also personally identifying information (PII) and even
patterns of access – are increasingly prevalent on the Web, being evident in
potentially every HTTP request made. </t>
      <t>Attacks such as FireSheep <xref target="firesheep"/> showed how easy it is to gather such
information when it is sent in the clear, and incidents such as Google’s
collection of unencrypted data by its StreetView Cars <xref target="streetview"/> further
illustrated the risks.</t>
      <t>In adopting SPDY as the basis of HTTP/2 <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2"/>, the HTTPbis
Working Group agreed not to make TLS mandatory to implement (MtI) or mandatory
to use (MtU) in our charter, despite an IETF policy to prefer the “best
security available” <xref target="RFC3365"/>.</t>
      <t>There were a variety of reasons for this, but most significantly, HTTP is used
for much more than the traditional browsing case, and encryption is not needed
for all of these uses. Making encryption MtU or MtI was seen as unlikely to
succeed because of the wide deployment of HTTP URIs.</t>
      <t>However, since making that decision, there have been developments that
have caused the Working Group to discuss these issues again:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Active contributors to some browser implementations have stated that their
products will not use HTTP/2 over unencrypted connections. If this eventuates,
it will prevent wide deployment of the new protocol (i.e., it couldn’t be used
with those products for HTTP URIs; only HTTPS URIs).</t>
          <t>It has been reported that surveillance of HTTP traffic takes place on a
broad scale <xref target="xkeyscore"/>. While the IETF does not take a formal, moral
position on wiretapping, we do have a strongly held belief “that both
commercial development of the Internet and adequate privacy for its users
against illegal intrusion requires the wide availability of strong
cryptographic technology” <xref target="RFC2804"/>. This requirement for privacy is further
reinforced by <xref target="RFC6973"/>.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>As a result, we decided to revisit the issue of how encryption is used in
HTTP/2.0 at IETF87.</t>

      <section anchor="will-this-make-encryption-mandatory-in-http20" title="Will this make encryption mandatory in HTTP/2.0?">
        <t>Not in the sense that this proposal would have it required (with a MUST) in the
specification.</t>
        <t>What might happen, however, is that some browser implementers will take the
flexibility that this approach grants and decide to not negotiate for HTTP/2.0
without one of the encryption profiles. That means that servers would need to
implement one of the encryption-enabling profiles to interoperate using
HTTP/2.0 for HTTP URIs.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="no-certificate-checks-really" title="No certificate checks? Really?">
        <t>http2-tls-relaxed has the effect of relaxing certificate checks on “http://” -
but not “https://” - URIs when TLS is in use. Since TLS isn’t in use for any
“http://” URIs today, there is no net loss of security, and we gain some
privacy from passive attacks.</t>
        <t>This makes TLS signficantly simpler to deploy for servers; they are able to use
a self-signed certificate. </t>
        <t>Additionally, it is possible to detect some attacks by remembering what
certificate is used in the past “pinning” or third-party verification of the
certificate in use. This may offer a way to gain stronger authentication of the
origin server’s identity, and mitigate downgrade attacks (although doing so is
out of the scope of this document).</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="why-do-this-if-a-downgrade-attack-is-so-easy" title="Why do this if a downgrade attack is so easy?">
        <t>There are many attack scenarios (e.g., third parties in coffee shops) where
active attacks are not feasible, or much more difficult. </t>
        <t>Additionally, active attacks can often be detected, because they change
protocol interactions; as such, they bring a risk of discovery.</t>

      <t>No current implementations.</t>
      <t>It is expected that if this proposal is adopted, first interop will be achieved by:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Specifying a set of ALPN protocol identifiers with TLS variants (possibly including -relaxed), with an appropriate level of detail for each.</t>
          <t>Nominating a set of negotiation mechanisms targeted for interop (e.g., Alt-Svc).</t>
