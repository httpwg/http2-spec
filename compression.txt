1.  Introduction

   In HTTP/1.1 (see [RFC7230]), header fields are not compressed.  As
   web pages have grown to require dozens to hundreds of requests, the
   redundant header fields in these requests unnecessarily consume
   bandwidth, measurably increasing latency.

   SPDY [SPDY] initially addressed this redundancy by compressing header
   fields using the DEFLATE [DEFLATE] format, which proved very
   effective at efficiently representing the redundant header fields.
   However, that approach exposed a security risk as demonstrated by the
   CRIME (Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy) attack (see [CRIME]).

Internet-Draft                    HPACK                         May 2015


   This specification defines HPACK, a new compressor that eliminates
   redundant header fields, limits vulnerability to known security
   attacks, and has a bounded memory requirement for use in constrained
   environments.  Potential security concerns for HPACK are described in
   Section 7.

   The HPACK format is intentionally simple and inflexible.  Both
   characteristics reduce the risk of interoperability or security
   issues due to implementation error.  No extensibility mechanisms are
   defined; changes to the format are only possible by defining a
   complete replacement.

1.1.  Overview

   The format defined in this specification treats a list of header
   fields as an ordered collection of name-value pairs that can include
   duplicate pairs.  Names and values are considered to be opaque
   sequences of octets, and the order of header fields is preserved
   after being compressed and decompressed.

   Encoding is informed by header field tables that map header fields to
   indexed values.  These header field tables can be incrementally
   updated as new header fields are encoded or decoded.

   In the encoded form, a header field is represented either literally
   or as a reference to a header field in one of the header field
   tables.  Therefore, a list of header fields can be encoded using a
   mixture of references and literal values.

   Literal values are either encoded directly or use a static Huffman
   code.

   The encoder is responsible for deciding which header fields to insert
   as new entries in the header field tables.  The decoder executes the
   modifications to the header field tables prescribed by the encoder,
   reconstructing the list of header fields in the process.  This
   enables decoders to remain simple and interoperate with a wide
   variety of encoders.

   Examples illustrating the use of these different mechanisms to
   represent header fields are available in Appendix C.

1.2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   All numeric values are in network byte order.  Values are unsigned
   unless otherwise indicated.  Literal values are provided in decimal
   or hexadecimal as appropriate.

1.3.  Terminology

   This specification uses the following terms:

   Header Field:  A name-value pair.  Both the name and value are
      treated as opaque sequences of octets.

   Dynamic Table:  The dynamic table (see Section 2.3.2) is a table that
      associates stored header fields with index values.  This table is
      dynamic and specific to an encoding or decoding context.

   Static Table:  The static table (see Section 2.3.1) is a table that
      statically associates header fields that occur frequently with
      index values.  This table is ordered, read-only, always
      accessible, and it may be shared amongst all encoding or decoding
      contexts.

   Header List:  A header list is an ordered collection of header fields
      that are encoded jointly and can contain duplicate header fields.
      A complete list of header fields contained in an HTTP/2 header
      block is a header list.

   Header Field Representation:  A header field can be represented in
      encoded form either as a literal or as an index (see Section 2.4).

   Header Block:  An ordered list of header field representations,
      which, when decoded, yields a complete header list.

2.  Compression Process Overview

   This specification does not describe a specific algorithm for an
   encoder.  Instead, it defines precisely how a decoder is expected to
   operate, allowing encoders to produce any encoding that this
   definition permits.

2.1.  Header List Ordering

   HPACK preserves the ordering of header fields inside the header list.
   An encoder MUST order header field representations in the header
   block according to their ordering in the original header list.  A
   decoder MUST order header fields in the decoded header list according
   to their ordering in the header block.

Internet-Draft                    HPACK                         May 2015


2.2.  Encoding and Decoding Contexts

   To decompress header blocks, a decoder only needs to maintain a
   dynamic table (see Section 2.3.2) as a decoding context.  No other
   dynamic state is needed.

   When used for bidirectional communication, such as in HTTP, the
   encoding and decoding dynamic tables maintained by an endpoint are
   completely independent, i.e., the request and response dynamic tables
   are separate.

2.3.  Indexing Tables

   HPACK uses two tables for associating header fields to indexes.  The
   static table (see Section 2.3.1) is predefined and contains common
   header fields (most of them with an empty value).  The dynamic table
   (see Section 2.3.2) is dynamic and can be used by the encoder to
   index header fields repeated in the encoded header lists.

   These two tables are combined into a single address space for
   defining index values (see Section 2.3.3).

2.3.1.  Static Table

   The static table consists of a predefined static list of header
   fields.  Its entries are defined in Appendix A.

2.3.2.  Dynamic Table

   The dynamic table consists of a list of header fields maintained in
   first-in, first-out order.  The first and newest entry in a dynamic
   table is at the lowest index, and the oldest entry of a dynamic table
   is at the highest index.

   The dynamic table is initially empty.  Entries are added as each
   header block is decompressed.

   The dynamic table can contain duplicate entries (i.e., entries with
   the same name and same value).  Therefore, duplicate entries MUST NOT
   be treated as an error by a decoder.

   The encoder decides how to update the dynamic table and as such can
   control how much memory is used by the dynamic table.  To limit the
   memory requirements of the decoder, the dynamic table size is
   strictly bounded (see Section 4.2).

   The decoder updates the dynamic table during the processing of a list
   of header field representations (see Section 3.2).

2.3.3.  Index Address Space

   The static table and the dynamic table are combined into a single
   index address space.

   Indices between 1 and the length of the static table (inclusive)
   refer to elements in the static table (see Section 2.3.1).

   Indices strictly greater than the length of the static table refer to
   elements in the dynamic table (see Section 2.3.2).  The length of the
   static table is subtracted to find the index into the dynamic table.

   Indices strictly greater than the sum of the lengths of both tables
   MUST be treated as a decoding error.

   For a static table size of s and a dynamic table size of k, the
   following diagram shows the entire valid index address space.

           <----------  Index Address Space ---------->
           <-- Static  Table -->  <-- Dynamic Table -->
           +---+-----------+---+  +---+-----------+---+
           | 1 |    ...    | s |  |s+1|    ...    |s+k|

2.4.  Header Field Representation

   An encoded header field can be represented either as an index or as a
   literal.

   An indexed representation defines a header field as a reference to an
   entry in either the static table or the dynamic table (see
   Section 6.1).

   A literal representation defines a header field by specifying its
   name and value.  The header field name can be represented literally
   or as a reference to an entry in either the static table or the
   dynamic table.  The header field value is represented literally.

   Three different literal representations are defined:

   o  A literal representation that adds the header field as a new entry
      at the beginning of the dynamic table (see Section 6.2.1).

Internet-Draft                    HPACK                         May 2015


   o  A literal representation that does not add the header field to the
      dynamic table (see Section 6.2.2).

   o  A literal representation that does not add the header field to the
      dynamic table, with the additional stipulation that this header
      field always use a literal representation, in particular when re-
      encoded by an intermediary (see Section 6.2.3).  This
      representation is intended for protecting header field values that
      are not to be put at risk by compressing them (see Section 7.1.3
      for more details).

   The selection of one of these literal representations can be guided
   by security considerations, in order to protect sensitive header
   field values (see Section 7.1).

   The literal representation of a header field name or of a header
   field value can encode the sequence of octets either directly or
   using a static Huffman code (see Section 5.2).

3.  Header Block Decoding

3.1.  Header Block Processing

   A decoder processes a header block sequentially to reconstruct the
   original header list.

   A header block is the concatenation of header field representations.
   The different possible header field representations are described in
   Section 6.

   Once a header field is decoded and added to the reconstructed header
   list, the header field cannot be removed.  A header field added to
   the header list can be safely passed to the application.

   By passing the resulting header fields to the application, a decoder
   can be implemented with minimal transitory memory commitment in
   addition to the memory required for the dynamic table.

3.2.  Header Field Representation Processing

   The processing of a header block to obtain a header list is defined
   in this section.  To ensure that the decoding will successfully
   produce a header list, a decoder MUST obey the following rules.

   All the header field representations contained in a header block are
   processed in the order in which they appear, as specified below.
   Details on the formatting of the various header field representations
   and some additional processing instructions are found in Section 6.

   An _indexed representation_ entails the following actions:

   o  The header field corresponding to the referenced entry in either
      the static table or dynamic table is appended to the decoded
      header list.

   A _literal representation_ that is _not added_ to the dynamic table
   entails the following action:

   o  The header field is appended to the decoded header list.

   A _literal representation_ that is _added_ to the dynamic table
   entails the following actions:

   o  The header field is appended to the decoded header list.

   o  The header field is inserted at the beginning of the dynamic
      table.  This insertion could result in the eviction of previous
      entries in the dynamic table (see Section 4.4).

4.  Dynamic Table Management

   To limit the memory requirements on the decoder side, the dynamic
   table is constrained in size.

4.1.  Calculating Table Size

   The size of the dynamic table is the sum of the size of its entries.

   The size of an entry is the sum of its name's length in octets (as
   defined in Section 5.2), its value's length in octets, and 32.

   The size of an entry is calculated using the length of its name and
   value without any Huffman encoding applied.

      Note: The additional 32 octets account for an estimated overhead
      associated with an entry.  For example, an entry structure using
      two 64-bit pointers to reference the name and the value of the
      entry and two 64-bit integers for counting the number of
      references to the name and value would have 32 octets of overhead.

4.2.  Maximum Table Size

   Protocols that use HPACK determine the maximum size that the encoder
   is permitted to use for the dynamic table.  In HTTP/2, this value is
   determined by the SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE setting (see
   Section 6.5.2 of [HTTP2]).

   An encoder can choose to use less capacity than this maximum size
   (see Section 6.3), but the chosen size MUST stay lower than or equal
   to the maximum set by the protocol.

   A change in the maximum size of the dynamic table is signaled via a
   dynamic table size update (see Section 6.3).  This dynamic table size
   update MUST occur at the beginning of the first header block
   following the change to the dynamic table size.  In HTTP/2, this
   follows a settings acknowledgment (see Section 6.5.3 of [HTTP2]).

   Multiple updates to the maximum table size can occur between the
   transmission of two header blocks.  In the case that this size is
   changed more than once in this interval, the smallest maximum table
   size that occurs in that interval MUST be signaled in a dynamic table
   size update.  The final maximum size is always signaled, resulting in
   at most two dynamic table size updates.  This ensures that the
   decoder is able to perform eviction based on reductions in dynamic
   table size (see Section 4.3).

   This mechanism can be used to completely clear entries from the
   dynamic table by setting a maximum size of 0, which can subsequently
   be restored.

4.3.  Entry Eviction When Dynamic Table Size Changes

   Whenever the maximum size for the dynamic table is reduced, entries
   are evicted from the end of the dynamic table until the size of the
   dynamic table is less than or equal to the maximum size.

4.4.  Entry Eviction When Adding New Entries

   Before a new entry is added to the dynamic table, entries are evicted
   from the end of the dynamic table until the size of the dynamic table
   is less than or equal to (maximum size - new entry size) or until the
   table is empty.

   If the size of the new entry is less than or equal to the maximum
   size, that entry is added to the table.  It is not an error to
   attempt to add an entry that is larger than the maximum size; an
   attempt to add an entry larger than the maximum size causes the table
   to be emptied of all existing entries and results in an empty table.

   A new entry can reference the name of an entry in the dynamic table
   that will be evicted when adding this new entry into the dynamic
   table.  Implementations are cautioned to avoid deleting the
   referenced name if the referenced entry is evicted from the dynamic
   table prior to inserting the new entry.

5.  Primitive Type Representations

   HPACK encoding uses two primitive types: unsigned variable-length
   integers and strings of octets.

5.1.  Integer Representation

   Integers are used to represent name indexes, header field indexes, or
   string lengths.  An integer representation can start anywhere within
   an octet.  To allow for optimized processing, an integer
   representation always finishes at the end of an octet.

   An integer is represented in two parts: a prefix that fills the
   current octet and an optional list of octets that are used if the
   integer value does not fit within the prefix.  The number of bits of
   the prefix (called N) is a parameter of the integer representation.

   If the integer value is small enough, i.e., strictly less than 2^N-1,
   it is encoded within the N-bit prefix.

     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   | ? | ? | ? |       Value       |
   +---+---+---+-------------------+

    Figure 2: Integer Value Encoded within the Prefix (Shown for N = 5)

   Otherwise, all the bits of the prefix are set to 1, and the value,
   decreased by 2^N-1, is encoded using a list of one or more octets.
   The most significant bit of each octet is used as a continuation
   flag: its value is set to 1 except for the last octet in the list.
   The remaining bits of the octets are used to encode the decreased
   value.

     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   | ? | ? | ? | 1   1   1   1   1 |
   +---+---+---+-------------------+
   | 1 |    Value-(2^N-1) LSB      |
   +---+---------------------------+
                  ...
   +---+---------------------------+
   | 0 |    Value-(2^N-1) MSB      |
   +---+---------------------------+

   Decoding the integer value from the list of octets starts by
   reversing the order of the octets in the list.  Then, for each octet,
   its most significant bit is removed.  The remaining bits of the
   octets are concatenated, and the resulting value is increased by
   2^N-1 to obtain the integer value.

   The prefix size, N, is always between 1 and 8 bits.  An integer
   starting at an octet boundary will have an 8-bit prefix.

   Pseudocode to represent an integer I is as follows:

   if I < 2^N - 1, encode I on N bits
   else
       encode (2^N - 1) on N bits
       I = I - (2^N - 1)
       while I >= 128
            encode (I % 128 + 128) on 8 bits
            I = I / 128
       encode I on 8 bits

   Pseudocode to decode an integer I is as follows:

   decode I from the next N bits
   if I < 2^N - 1, return I
   else
       M = 0
       repeat
           B = next octet
           I = I + (B & 127) * 2^M
           M = M + 7
       while B & 128 == 128
       return I

   Examples illustrating the encoding of integers are available in
   Appendix C.1.

   This integer representation allows for values of indefinite size.  It
   is also possible for an encoder to send a large number of zero
   values, which can waste octets and could be used to overflow integer
   values.  Integer encodings that exceed implementation limits -- in
   value or octet length -- MUST be treated as decoding errors.
   Different limits can be set for each of the different uses of
   integers, based on implementation constraints.

5.2.  String Literal Representation

   Header field names and header field values can be represented as
   string literals.  A string literal is encoded as a sequence of
   octets, either by directly encoding the string literal's octets or by
   using a Huffman code (see [HUFFMAN]).

     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   | H |    String Length (7+)     |
   +---+---------------------------+
   |  String Data (Length octets)  |
   +-------------------------------+

                  Figure 4: String Literal Representation

   A string literal representation contains the following fields:

   H: A one-bit flag, H, indicating whether or not the octets of the
      string are Huffman encoded.

   String Length:  The number of octets used to encode the string
      literal, encoded as an integer with a 7-bit prefix (see
      Section 5.1).

   String Data:  The encoded data of the string literal.  If H is '0',
      then the encoded data is the raw octets of the string literal.  If
      H is '1', then the encoded data is the Huffman encoding of the
      string literal.

   String literals that use Huffman encoding are encoded with the
   Huffman code defined in Appendix B (see examples for requests in
   Appendix C.4 and for responses in Appendix C.6).  The encoded data is
   the bitwise concatenation of the codes corresponding to each octet of
   the string literal.

   As the Huffman-encoded data doesn't always end at an octet boundary,
   some padding is inserted after it, up to the next octet boundary.  To
   prevent this padding from being misinterpreted as part of the string
   literal, the most significant bits of the code corresponding to the
   EOS (end-of-string) symbol are used.

   Upon decoding, an incomplete code at the end of the encoded data is
   to be considered as padding and discarded.  A padding strictly longer
   than 7 bits MUST be treated as a decoding error.  A padding not
   corresponding to the most significant bits of the code for the EOS
   symbol MUST be treated as a decoding error.  A Huffman-encoded string

   literal containing the EOS symbol MUST be treated as a decoding
   error.

6.  Binary Format

   This section describes the detailed format of each of the different
   header field representations and the dynamic table size update
   instruction.

6.1.  Indexed Header Field Representation

   An indexed header field representation identifies an entry in either
   the static table or the dynamic table (see Section 2.3).

   An indexed header field representation causes a header field to be
   added to the decoded header list, as described in Section 3.2.

     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   | 1 |        Index (7+)         |
   +---+---------------------------+

                      Figure 5: Indexed Header Field

   An indexed header field starts with the '1' 1-bit pattern, followed
   by the index of the matching header field, represented as an integer
   with a 7-bit prefix (see Section 5.1).

   The index value of 0 is not used.  It MUST be treated as a decoding
   error if found in an indexed header field representation.

6.2.  Literal Header Field Representation

   A literal header field representation contains a literal header field
   value.  Header field names are provided either as a literal or by
   reference to an existing table entry, either from the static table or
   the dynamic table (see Section 2.3).

   This specification defines three forms of literal header field
   representations: with indexing, without indexing, and never indexed.

6.2.1.  Literal Header Field with Incremental Indexing

   A literal header field with incremental indexing representation
   results in appending a header field to the decoded header list and
   inserting it as a new entry into the dynamic table.

   Figure 7: Literal Header Field with Incremental Indexing -- New Name

   A literal header field with incremental indexing representation
   starts with the '01' 2-bit pattern.

   If the header field name matches the header field name of an entry
   stored in the static table or the dynamic table, the header field
   name can be represented using the index of that entry.  In this case,
   the index of the entry is represented as an integer with a 6-bit
   prefix (see Section 5.1).  This value is always non-zero.

   Otherwise, the header field name is represented as a string literal
   (see Section 5.2).  A value 0 is used in place of the 6-bit index,
   followed by the header field name.

   Either form of header field name representation is followed by the
   header field value represented as a string literal (see Section 5.2).

6.2.2.  Literal Header Field without Indexing

   A literal header field without indexing representation results in
   appending a header field to the decoded header list without altering
   the dynamic table.

        Figure 9: Literal Header Field without Indexing -- New Name

   A literal header field without indexing representation starts with
   the '0000' 4-bit pattern.

   If the header field name matches the header field name of an entry
   stored in the static table or the dynamic table, the header field
   name can be represented using the index of that entry.  In this case,
   the index of the entry is represented as an integer with a 4-bit
   prefix (see Section 5.1).  This value is always non-zero.

   Otherwise, the header field name is represented as a string literal
   (see Section 5.2).  A value 0 is used in place of the 4-bit index,
   followed by the header field name.

   Either form of header field name representation is followed by the
   header field value represented as a string literal (see Section 5.2).

6.2.3.  Literal Header Field Never Indexed

   A literal header field never-indexed representation results in
   appending a header field to the decoded header list without altering
   the dynamic table.  Intermediaries MUST use the same representation
   for encoding this header field.

         Figure 11: Literal Header Field Never Indexed -- New Name

   A literal header field never-indexed representation starts with the
   '0001' 4-bit pattern.

   When a header field is represented as a literal header field never
   indexed, it MUST always be encoded with this specific literal
   representation.  In particular, when a peer sends a header field that
   it received represented as a literal header field never indexed, it
   MUST use the same representation to forward this header field.

   This representation is intended for protecting header field values
   that are not to be put at risk by compressing them (see Section 7.1
   for more details).

   The encoding of the representation is identical to the literal header
   field without indexing (see Section 6.2.2).

6.3.  Dynamic Table Size Update

   A dynamic table size update signals a change to the size of the
   dynamic table.

               Figure 12: Maximum Dynamic Table Size Change

   A dynamic table size update starts with the '001' 3-bit pattern,
   followed by the new maximum size, represented as an integer with a
   5-bit prefix (see Section 5.1).

   The new maximum size MUST be lower than or equal to the limit
   determined by the protocol using HPACK.  A value that exceeds this
   limit MUST be treated as a decoding error.  In HTTP/2, this limit is
   the last value of the SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE parameter (see
   Section 6.5.2 of [HTTP2]) received from the decoder and acknowledged
   by the encoder (see Section 6.5.3 of [HTTP2]).

   Reducing the maximum size of the dynamic table can cause entries to
   be evicted (see Section 4.3).

7.  Security Considerations

   This section describes potential areas of security concern with
   HPACK:

   o  Use of compression as a length-based oracle for verifying guesses
      about secrets that are compressed into a shared compression
      context.

   o  Denial of service resulting from exhausting processing or memory
      capacity at a decoder.

7.1.  Probing Dynamic Table State

   HPACK reduces the length of header field encodings by exploiting the
   redundancy inherent in protocols like HTTP.  The ultimate goal of
   this is to reduce the amount of data that is required to send HTTP
   requests or responses.

   The compression context used to encode header fields can be probed by
   an attacker who can both define header fields to be encoded and
   transmitted and observe the length of those fields once they are
   encoded.  When an attacker can do both, they can adaptively modify
   requests in order to confirm guesses about the dynamic table state.
   If a guess is compressed into a shorter length, the attacker can
   observe the encoded length and infer that the guess was correct.

Internet-Draft                    HPACK                         May 2015


   This is possible even over the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   protocol (see [TLS12]), because while TLS provides confidentiality
   protection for content, it only provides a limited amount of
   protection for the length of that content.

      Note: Padding schemes only provide limited protection against an
      attacker with these capabilities, potentially only forcing an
      increased number of guesses to learn the length associated with a
      given guess.  Padding schemes also work directly against
      compression by increasing the number of bits that are transmitted.

   Attacks like CRIME [CRIME] demonstrated the existence of these
   general attacker capabilities.  The specific attack exploited the
   fact that DEFLATE [DEFLATE] removes redundancy based on prefix
   matching.  This permitted the attacker to confirm guesses a character
   at a time, reducing an exponential-time attack into a linear-time
   attack.

7.1.1.  Applicability to HPACK and HTTP

   HPACK mitigates but does not completely prevent attacks modeled on
   CRIME [CRIME] by forcing a guess to match an entire header field
   value rather than individual characters.  Attackers can only learn
   whether a guess is correct or not, so they are reduced to brute-force
   guesses for the header field values.

   The viability of recovering specific header field values therefore
   depends on the entropy of values.  As a result, values with high
   entropy are unlikely to be recovered successfully.  However, values
   with low entropy remain vulnerable.

   Attacks of this nature are possible any time that two mutually
   distrustful entities control requests or responses that are placed
   onto a single HTTP/2 connection.  If the shared HPACK compressor
   permits one entity to add entries to the dynamic table and the other
   to access those entries, then the state of the table can be learned.

   Having requests or responses from mutually distrustful entities
   occurs when an intermediary either:

   o  sends requests from multiple clients on a single connection toward
      an origin server, or

   o  takes responses from multiple origin servers and places them on a
      shared connection toward a client.

Internet-Draft                    HPACK                         May 2015


   Web browsers also need to assume that requests made on the same
   connection by different web origins [ORIGIN] are made by mutually
   distrustful entities.

7.1.2.  Mitigation

   Users of HTTP that require confidentiality for header fields can use
   values with entropy sufficient to make guessing infeasible.  However,
   this is impractical as a general solution because it forces all users
   of HTTP to take steps to mitigate attacks.  It would impose new
   constraints on how HTTP is used.

   Rather than impose constraints on users of HTTP, an implementation of
   HPACK can instead constrain how compression is applied in order to
   limit the potential for dynamic table probing.

   An ideal solution segregates access to the dynamic table based on the
   entity that is constructing header fields.  Header field values that
   are added to the table are attributed to an entity, and only the
   entity that created a particular value can extract that value.

   To improve compression performance of this option, certain entries
   might be tagged as being public.  For example, a web browser might
   make the values of the Accept-Encoding header field available in all
   requests.

   An encoder without good knowledge of the provenance of header fields
   might instead introduce a penalty for a header field with many
   different values, such that a large number of attempts to guess a
   header field value results in the header field no longer being
   compared to the dynamic table entries in future messages, effectively
   preventing further guesses.

      Note: Simply removing entries corresponding to the header field
      from the dynamic table can be ineffectual if the attacker has a
      reliable way of causing values to be reinstalled.  For example, a
      request to load an image in a web browser typically includes the
      Cookie header field (a potentially highly valued target for this
      sort of attack), and web sites can easily force an image to be
      loaded, thereby refreshing the entry in the dynamic table.

   This response might be made inversely proportional to the length of
   the header field value.  Marking a header field as not using the
   dynamic table anymore might occur for shorter values more quickly or
   with higher probability than for longer values.

7.1.3.  Never-Indexed Literals

   Implementations can also choose to protect sensitive header fields by
   not compressing them and instead encoding their value as literals.

   Refusing to generate an indexed representation for a header field is
   only effective if compression is avoided on all hops.  The never-
   indexed literal (see Section 6.2.3) can be used to signal to
   intermediaries that a particular value was intentionally sent as a
   literal.

   An intermediary MUST NOT re-encode a value that uses the never-
   indexed literal representation with another representation that would
   index it.  If HPACK is used for re-encoding, the never-indexed
   literal representation MUST be used.

   The choice to use a never-indexed literal representation for a header
   field depends on several factors.  Since HPACK doesn't protect
   against guessing an entire header field value, short or low-entropy
   values are more readily recovered by an adversary.  Therefore, an
   encoder might choose not to index values with low entropy.

   An encoder might also choose not to index values for header fields
   that are considered to be highly valuable or sensitive to recovery,
   such as the Cookie or Authorization header fields.

   On the contrary, an encoder might prefer indexing values for header
   fields that have little or no value if they were exposed.  For
   instance, a User-Agent header field does not commonly vary between
   requests and is sent to any server.  In that case, confirmation that
   a particular User-Agent value has been used provides little value.

   Note that these criteria for deciding to use a never-indexed literal
   representation will evolve over time as new attacks are discovered.

7.2.  Static Huffman Encoding

   There is no currently known attack against a static Huffman encoding.
   A study has shown that using a static Huffman encoding table created
   an information leakage; however, this same study concluded that an
   attacker could not take advantage of this information leakage to
   recover any meaningful amount of information (see [PETAL]).

7.3.  Memory Consumption

   An attacker can try to cause an endpoint to exhaust its memory.
   HPACK is designed to limit both the peak and state amounts of memory
   allocated by an endpoint.

   The amount of memory used by the compressor is limited by the
   protocol using HPACK through the definition of the maximum size of
   the dynamic table.  In HTTP/2, this value is controlled by the
   decoder through the setting parameter SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE (see
   Section 6.5.2 of [HTTP2]).  This limit takes into account both the
   size of the data stored in the dynamic table, plus a small allowance
   for overhead.

   A decoder can limit the amount of state memory used by setting an
   appropriate value for the maximum size of the dynamic table.  In
   HTTP/2, this is realized by setting an appropriate value for the
   SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE parameter.  An encoder can limit the
   amount of state memory it uses by signaling a lower dynamic table
   size than the decoder allows (see Section 6.3).

   The amount of temporary memory consumed by an encoder or decoder can
   be limited by processing header fields sequentially.  An
   implementation does not need to retain a complete list of header
   fields.  Note, however, that it might be necessary for an application
   to retain a complete header list for other reasons; even though HPACK
   does not force this to occur, application constraints might make this
   necessary.

7.4.  Implementation Limits

   An implementation of HPACK needs to ensure that large values for
   integers, long encoding for integers, or long string literals do not
   create security weaknesses.

   An implementation has to set a limit for the values it accepts for
   integers, as well as for the encoded length (see Section 5.1).  In
   the same way, it has to set a limit to the length it accepts for
   string literals (see Section 5.2).

Appendix A.  Static Table Definition

   The static table (see Section 2.3.1) consists in a predefined and
   unchangeable list of header fields.

   The static table was created from the most frequent header fields
   used by popular web sites, with the addition of HTTP/2-specific
   pseudo-header fields (see Section 8.1.2.1 of [HTTP2]).  For header
   fields with a few frequent values, an entry was added for each of
   these frequent values.  For other header fields, an entry was added
   with an empty value.

   Table 1 lists the predefined header fields that make up the static
   table and gives the index of each entry.

Appendix B.  Huffman Code

   The following Huffman code is used when encoding string literals with
   a Huffman coding (see Section 5.2).

   This Huffman code was generated from statistics obtained on a large
   sample of HTTP headers.  It is a canonical Huffman code (see
   [CANONICAL]) with some tweaking to ensure that no symbol has a unique
   code length.

   Each row in the table defines the code used to represent a symbol:

   sym:  The symbol to be represented.  It is the decimal value of an
      octet, possibly prepended with its ASCII representation.  A
      specific symbol, "EOS", is used to indicate the end of a string
      literal.

   code as bits:  The Huffman code for the symbol represented as a
      base-2 integer, aligned on the most significant bit (MSB).

   code as hex:  The Huffman code for the symbol, represented as a
      hexadecimal integer, aligned on the least significant bit (LSB).

   len:  The number of bits for the code representing the symbol.

   As an example, the code for the symbol 47 (corresponding to the ASCII
   character "/") consists in the 6 bits "0", "1", "1", "0", "0", "0".
   This corresponds to the value 0x18 (in hexadecimal) encoded in 6
   bits.

C.1.  Integer Representation Examples

   This section shows the representation of integer values in detail
   (see Section 5.1).

C.1.1.  Example 1: Encoding 10 Using a 5-Bit Prefix

   The value 10 is to be encoded with a 5-bit prefix.

   o  10 is less than 31 (2^5 - 1) and is represented using the 5-bit
      prefix.

     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   | X | X | X | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |   10 stored on 5 bits
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

C.1.2.  Example 2: Encoding 1337 Using a 5-Bit Prefix

   The value I=1337 is to be encoded with a 5-bit prefix.

      1337 is greater than 31 (2^5 - 1).



         The 5-bit prefix is filled with its max value (31).

      I = 1337 - (2^5 - 1) = 1306.



         I (1306) is greater than or equal to 128, so the while loop
         body executes:



            I % 128 == 26

            26 + 128 == 154

            154 is encoded in 8 bits as: 10011010

            I is set to 10 (1306 / 128 == 10)

            I is no longer greater than or equal to 128, so the while
            loop terminates.

         I, now 10, is encoded in 8 bits as: 00001010.

C.1.3.  Example 3: Encoding 42 Starting at an Octet Boundary

   The value 42 is to be encoded starting at an octet boundary.  This
   implies that a 8-bit prefix is used.

   o  42 is less than 255 (2^8 - 1) and is represented using the 8-bit
      prefix.

C.2.  Header Field Representation Examples

   This section shows several independent representation examples.

C.2.1.  Literal Header Field with Indexing

   The header field representation uses a literal name and a literal
   value.  The header field is added to the dynamic table.

   Header list to encode:

   custom-key: custom-header

         Table size:  55

   Decoded header list:

   custom-key: custom-header

C.2.2.  Literal Header Field without Indexing

   The header field representation uses an indexed name and a literal
   value.  The header field is not added to the dynamic table.

   Header list to encode:

   :path: /sample/path

   Hex dump of encoded data:

   040c 2f73 616d 706c 652f 7061 7468      | ../sample/path

C.2.3.  Literal Header Field Never Indexed

   The header field representation uses a literal name and a literal
   value.  The header field is not added to the dynamic table and must
   use the same representation if re-encoded by an intermediary.

   Header list to encode:

   password: secret

   Hex dump of encoded data:

C.5.  Response Examples without Huffman Coding

   This section shows several consecutive header lists, corresponding to
   HTTP responses, on the same connection.  The HTTP/2 setting parameter
   SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE is set to the value of 256 octets, causing
   some evictions to occur.

C.6.  Response Examples with Huffman Coding

   This section shows the same examples as the previous section but uses
   Huffman encoding for the literal values.  The HTTP/2 setting
   parameter SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE is set to the value of 256
   octets, causing some evictions to occur.  The eviction mechanism uses
   the length of the decoded literal values, so the same evictions occur
   as in the previous section.
