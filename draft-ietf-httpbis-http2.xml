    <abstract>
      <t>
        This specification describes an optimized expression of the syntax of the Hypertext Transfer
        Protocol (HTTP). The HTTP/2.0 encapsulation enables more efficient use of network resources
        and reduced perception of latency by allowing header field compression and multiple
        concurrent messages on the same connection. It also introduces unsolicited push of
        representations from servers to clients.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document is an alternative to, but does not obsolete the HTTP/1.1 message format or
        protocol. HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      
      <t>
        The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a wildly successful protocol. However, the
        HTTP/1.1 message format (<xref target="HTTP-p1" x:fmt="," x:rel="#http.message"/>) is
        optimized for implementation simplicity and accessibility, not application performance.  As
        such it has several characteristics that have a negative overall effect on application
        performance.
      </t>
      <t>
        In particular, HTTP/1.0 only allows one request to be delivered at a time on a given
        connection.  HTTP/1.1 pipelining only partially addressed request concurrency, and is not
        widely deployed.  Therefore, clients that need to make many requests (as is common on the
        Web) typically use multiple connections to a server in order to reduce perceived latency.
      </t>
      <t>
        Furthermore, HTTP/1.1 header fields are often repetitive and verbose, which, in addition to
        generating more or larger network packets, can cause the small initial TCP congestion window
        to quickly fill.  This can result in excessive latency when multiple requests are made on a
        single new TCP connection.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document addresses these issues by defining an optimized mapping of HTTP's semantics to
        an underlying connection.  Specifically, it allows interleaving of request and response
        messages on the same connection and uses an efficient coding for HTTP header fields.  It
        also allows prioritization of requests, letting more important requests complete more
        quickly, further improving perceived performance.
      </t>
      <t>
        The resulting protocol is designed to be more friendly to the network, because fewer TCP
        connections can be used, in comparison to HTTP/1.x. This means less competition with other
        flows, and longer-lived connections, which in turn leads to better utilization of available
        network capacity.
      </t>
      <t>
        Finally, this encapsulation also enables more scalable processing of messages through use of
        binary message framing.
      </t>

        <t>
          The HTTP/2.0 Specification is split into three parts: <xref target="starting">starting
          HTTP/2.0</xref>, which covers how a HTTP/2.0 connection is initiated; <xref
          target="FramingLayer">a framing layer</xref>, which multiplexes a single TCP connection
          into independent frames of various types; and <xref target="HTTPLayer">an HTTP
          layer</xref>, which specifies the mechanism for expressing HTTP interactions using the
          framing layer. While some of the framing layer concepts are isolated from HTTP, building a
          generic framing layer has not been a goal. The framing layer is tailored to the needs of
          the HTTP protocol and server push.

        <t>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
          NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as

        <t>
          All numeric values are in network byte order.  Values are unsigned unless otherwise
          indicated.  Literal values are provided in decimal or hexadecimal as appropriate.
          Hexadecimal literals are prefixed with <spanx style="verb">0x</spanx> to distinguish them
          from decimal literals.
        </t>
        <t>
          The following terms are used:

    <section anchor="Overview" title="HTTP/2.0 Protocol Overview">
      <t>
        HTTP/2.0 provides an optimized transport for HTTP semantics.
      </t>
      <t>
        An HTTP/2.0 connection is an application level protocol running on top of a TCP connection
        (<xref target="RFC0793"/>). The client is the TCP connection initiator.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document describes the HTTP/2.0 protocol using a logical structure that is formed of
        three parts: framing, streams, and application mapping.  This structure is provided
        primarily as an aid to specification, implementations are free to diverge from this
        structure as necessary.
      </t>
      
      <section title="HTTP Frames">
        <t>
          HTTP/2.0 provides an efficient serialization of HTTP semantics.  HTTP requests and
          responses are encoded into length-prefixed frames (see <xref target="FrameHeader"/>).
        </t>
        <t>
          HTTP headers are compressed into a series of frames that contain header block fragments
          (see <xref target="HeaderBlock"/>).
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="HTTP Multiplexing">
        <t>
           HTTP/2.0 provides the ability to multiplex multiple HTTP requests and responses onto a
           single connection.  Multiple requests or responses can be sent concurrently on a
           connection using <xref target="StreamsLayer">streams</xref>.  In order to maintain
           independent streams, flow control and prioritization are necessary.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="HTTP Semantics">
        <t>
          HTTP/2.0 defines how HTTP requests and responses are mapped to streams (see <xref
          target="HttpSequence"/>) and introduces a new interaction model, <xref
          target="PushResources">server push</xref>.
        </t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section anchor="starting" title="Starting HTTP/2.0">
      <t>
        HTTP/2.0 uses the same "http" and "https" URI schemes used by HTTP/1.1. HTTP/2.0 shares the
        same default port numbers: 80 for "http" URIs and 443 for "https" URIs.  As a result,
        implementations processing requests for target resource URIs like <spanx
        style="verb">http://example.org/foo</spanx> or <spanx
        style="verb">https://example.com/bar</spanx> are required to first discover whether the
        upstream server (the immediate peer to which the client wishes to establish a connection)
        supports HTTP/2.0.
      </t>
 
      <t>
        The means by which support for HTTP/2.0 is determined is different for "http" and "https"
        URIs. Discovery for "http" URIs is described in <xref target="discover-http"/>.  Discovery
        for "https" URIs is described in <xref target="discover-https"/>.
      </t>

      <section anchor="versioning" title="HTTP/2.0 Version Identification">
        <t>
          The protocol defined in this document is identified using the string "HTTP/2.0".  This
          identification is used in the HTTP/1.1 Upgrade header field, in the <xref
          target="TLSALPN">TLS application layer protocol negotiation extension</xref> field, and
          other places where protocol identification is required.
        </t>
        <t>
          Negotiating "HTTP/2.0" implies the use of the transport, security, framing and message
          semantics described in this document.
        </t>
        <t>
          <cref>Editor's Note: please remove the remainder of this section prior to the publication
          of a final version of this document.</cref>
        </t>
        <t>
          Only implementations of the final, published RFC can identify themselves as "HTTP/2.0".
          Until such an RFC exists, implementations MUST NOT identify themselves using "HTTP/2.0".
        </t>
        <t>
          Examples and text throughout the rest of this document use "HTTP/2.0" as a matter of
          editorial convenience only.  Implementations of draft versions MUST NOT identify using
          this string.  The exception to this rule is the string included in the connection header
          sent by clients immediately after establishing an HTTP/2.0 connection (see <xref
          target="ConnectionHeader"/>); this fixed length sequence of octets does not change.
        </t>
        <t>
          Implementations of draft versions of the protocol MUST add the string "-draft-" and the
          corresponding draft number to the identifier before the separator ('/').  For example,
          draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-03 is identified using the string "HTTP-draft-03/2.0".
        </t>
        <t>
          Non-compatible experiments that are based on these draft versions MUST instead replace the
          string "draft" with a different identifier.  For example, an experimental implementation
          of packet mood-based encoding based on draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-07 might identify itself
          as "HTTP-emo-07/2.0".  Note that any label MUST conform to the "token" syntax defined in
          <xref target="HTTP-p1" x:fmt="of" x:rel="#field.components"/>.  Experimenters are
          encouraged to coordinate their experiments on the ietf-http-wg@w3.org mailing list.

      <section anchor="discover-http" title="Starting HTTP/2.0 for &quot;http&quot; URIs">
        <t>
          A client that makes a request to an "http" URI without prior knowledge about support for
          HTTP/2.0 uses the HTTP Upgrade mechanism (<xref target="HTTP-p1" x:fmt="of"
          x:rel="#header.upgrade"/>).  The client makes an HTTP/1.1 request that includes an Upgrade
          header field identifying HTTP/2.0.  The HTTP/1.1 request MUST include exactly one <xref
          target="Http2SettingsHeader">HTTP2-Settings</xref> header field.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>For example:</preamble>
          <artwork type="message/http; msgtype=&#34;request&#34;" x:indent-with="  ">
GET /default.htm HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Connection: Upgrade, HTTP2-Settings

</artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          Requests that contain a request entity body MUST be sent in their entirety before the
          client can send HTTP/2.0 frames.  This means that a large request entity can block the use
          of the connection until it is completely sent.
          <list>
            <t>
              If concurrency of an initial request with subsequent requests is important, a small
              request can be used to perform the upgrade to HTTP/2.0, at the cost of an additional
              round trip.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          A server that does not support HTTP/2.0 can respond to the request as though the Upgrade
          header field were absent:
        </t>
        <figure>

Content-type: text/html

...
</artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          A server that supports HTTP/2.0 accepts the upgrade with a 101 (Switching Protocols)
          status code.  After the empty line that terminates the 101 response, the server can begin
          sending HTTP/2.0 frames.  These frames MUST include a response to the request that
          initiated the Upgrade.
        </t>

        <figure>
          <artwork type="message/http; msgtype=&#34;response&#34;" x:indent-with="  ">

Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: HTTP/2.0

[ HTTP/2.0 connection ...
</artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          The first HTTP/2.0 frame sent by the server is a <x:ref>SETTINGS</x:ref> frame (<xref
          target="SETTINGS"/>). Upon receiving the 101 response, the client sends a <xref
          target="ConnectionHeader">connection header</xref>, which includes a
          <x:ref>SETTINGS</x:ref> frame.
        </t>
        <t>
          The HTTP/1.1 request that is sent prior to upgrade is associated with stream 1 and is
          assigned the highest possible priority.  Stream 1 is implicitly half closed from the
          client toward the server, since the request is completed as an HTTP/1.1 request.  After
          commencing the HTTP/2.0 connection, stream 1 is used for the response.

        <section anchor="Http2SettingsHeader" title="HTTP2-Settings Header Field">
          <t>
            A client that upgrades from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2.0 MUST include exactly one <spanx
            style="verb">HTTP2-Settings</spanx> header field.  The <spanx
            style="verb">HTTP2-Settings</spanx> header field is a hop-by-hop header field that
            includes settings that govern the HTTP/2.0 connection, provided in anticipation of the
            server accepting the request to upgrade.  A server MUST reject an attempt to upgrade if
            this header is not present.
          </t>

            The content of the <spanx style="verb">HTTP2-Settings</spanx> header field is the
            payload of a <x:ref>SETTINGS</x:ref> frame (<xref target="SETTINGS"/>), encoded as a
            base64url string (that is, the URL- and filename-safe Base64 encoding described in <xref
            target="RFC4648" x:fmt="of" x:sec="5"/>, with any trailing '=' characters omitted).  The
            <xref target="RFC5234">ABNF</xref> production for <spanx style="verb">token68</spanx> is

          <t>

            A server decodes and interprets these values as it would any other
            <x:ref>SETTINGS</x:ref> frame.  Providing these values in the Upgrade request ensures
            that the protocol does not require default values for the above settings, and gives a

          A client that makes a request to an "https" URI without prior knowledge about support for
          HTTP/2.0 uses <xref target="TLS12">TLS</xref> with the <xref target="TLSALPN">application
          layer protocol negotiation extension</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>

          A client can learn that a particular server supports HTTP/2.0 by other means.  A client
          MAY immediately send HTTP/2.0 frames to a server that is known to support HTTP/2.0, after
          the <xref target="ConnectionHeader">connection header</xref>.  This only affects the
          resolution of "http" URIs; servers supporting HTTP/2.0 are required to support <xref
          target="TLSALPN">protocol negotiation in TLS</xref> for "https" URIs.
        </t>
        <t>
          Prior support for HTTP/2.0 is not a strong signal that a given server will support
          HTTP/2.0 for future connections.  It is possible for server configurations to change or
          for configurations to differ between instances in clustered server.  Interception proxies
          (a.k.a. "transparent" proxies) are another source of variability.

          Upon establishment of a TCP connection and determination that HTTP/2.0 will be used by

          immediately upon receipt of a 101 Switching Protocols response (indicating a successful
          upgrade), or as the first application data octets of a TLS connection. If starting an

              The client connection header is selected so that a large proportion of HTTP/1.1 or

          To avoid unnecessary latency, clients are permitted to send additional frames to the

          A header in HTTP/2.0 is a name-value pair with one or more associated values. They are

          <xref target="PushResources" />).
        </t>
        <t>
          Header sets are logical collections of zero or more header fields arranged at the
          application layer.  When transmitted over a connection, the header set is serialized into
          a header block using <xref target="COMPRESSION">HTTP Header Compression</xref>.  The
          serialized header block is then divided into one or more octet sequences,
          called header block fragments, and transmitted within the payload of
          <xref target="HEADERS">HEADERS</xref>, <xref target="PUSH_PROMISE">PUSH_PROMISE</xref>
          or <xref target="CONTINUATION">CONTINUATION</xref> frames.
          The receiving endpoint reassembles the header block by concatenating the individual
          fragments, then decompresses the block to reconstruct the header set.
        </t>
        <t>
          Header block fragments can only be sent as the payload of <x:ref>HEADERS</x:ref>,

          A compressed and encoded header block is transmitted in a <x:ref>HEADERS</x:ref>
          or <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> frame, followed by zero or more <x:ref>CONTINUATION</x:ref> frames.
          If the number of octets in the block is greater
          than the space remaining in the frame, the block is divided into multiple fragments, which
          are then transmitted in multiple frames.
        </t>
        <t>
          Header blocks MUST be transmitted as a contiguous sequence of frames, with no interleaved
          frames of any other type, or from any other stream.
          The last frame in a sequence of
          <x:ref>HEADERS</x:ref>/<x:ref>CONTINUATION</x:ref> frames MUST have the END_HEADERS flag set.
          The last frame in a
          sequence of <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref>/<x:ref>CONTINUATION</x:ref> frames MUST have

          <x:ref>HEADERS</x:ref>, <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> or <x:ref>CONTINUATION</x:ref> frames MUST
          reassemble header blocks
          and perform decompression even if the frames are to be discarded, which is likely to occur
          after a stream is reset.  A receiver MUST terminate the connection with a <xref

            Streams are identified with an unsigned 31-bit integer.  Streams initiated by a client

            even-numbered stream identifiers.  A stream identifier of zero (0x0) is used for
            connection control message; the stream identifier zero MUST NOT be used to establish a
            new stream.  A stream identifier of one (0x1) is used to respond to the HTTP/1.1 request
            which was specified during Upgrade (see <xref target="discover-http"/>); the stream
            identifier one MUST NOT be used to establish a new stream.
          </t>
          <t>
            The identifier of a newly established stream MUST be numerically greater than all
            streams that the initiating endpoint has opened or reserved.  This governs streams that
            are opened using a <x:ref>HEADERS</x:ref> frame and streams that are reserved using
            <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref>.  An endpoint that receives an unexpected stream identifier

          <t>
            Stream identifiers cannot be reused.  Long-lived connections can result in endpoint

            maximum concurrent streams setting is specific to each endpoint and applies only to the

     <section anchor="FlowControl" title="Flow Control">
        <t>
          Using streams for multiplexing introduces contention over use of the TCP connection,
          resulting in blocked streams.  A flow control scheme ensures that streams on the same
          connection do not destructively interfere with each other.  Flow control is used for both
          individual streams and for the connection as a whole.
        </t>
        <t>
          HTTP/2.0 provides for flow control through use of the <x:ref>WINDOW_UPDATE</x:ref> frame
          type.
        </t>

        <section anchor="fc-principles" title="Flow Control Principles">
          <t>
            Experience with TCP congestion control has shown that algorithms can evolve over time to
            become more sophisticated without requiring protocol changes.  TCP congestion control
            and its evolution is clearly different from HTTP/2.0 flow control, though the evolution
            of TCP congestion control algorithms shows that a similar approach could be feasible for
            HTTP/2.0 flow control.
          </t>
          <t>
            HTTP/2.0 stream flow control aims to allow for future improvements to flow control
            algorithms without requiring protocol changes.  Flow control in HTTP/2.0 has the
            following characteristics:
            <list style="numbers">
              <t>
                Flow control is hop-by-hop, not end-to-end.
              </t>
              <t>
                Flow control is based on window update frames.  Receivers advertise how many bytes
                they are prepared to receive on a stream and for the entire connection.  This is a
                credit-based scheme.
              </t>
              <t>
                Flow control is directional with overall control provided by the receiver.  A
                receiver MAY choose to set any window size that it desires for each stream and for
                the entire connection.  A sender MUST respect flow control limits imposed by a
                receiver.  Clients, servers and intermediaries all independently advertise their
                flow control preferences as a receiver and abide by the flow control limits set by
                their peer when sending.
              </t>
              <t>
                The initial value for the flow control window is 65535 bytes for both new streams
                and the overall connection.
              </t>
              <t>
                The frame type determines whether flow control applies to a frame.  Of the frames
                specified in this document, only <x:ref>DATA</x:ref> frames are subject to flow
                control; all other frame types do not consume space in the advertised flow control
                window.  This ensures that important control frames are not blocked by flow control.
              </t>
              <t>
                Flow control can be disabled by a receiver.  A receiver can choose to disable both
                forms of flow control by sending the SETTINGS_FLOW_CONTROL_OPTIONS setting.  See
                <xref target="EndFlowControl">Ending Flow Control</xref> for more details.
              </t>
              <t>
                HTTP/2.0 standardizes only the format of the <x:ref>WINDOW_UPDATE</x:ref> frame
                (<xref target="WINDOW_UPDATE"/>).  This does not stipulate how a receiver decides
                when to send this frame or the value that it sends.  Nor does it specify how a
                sender chooses to send packets.  Implementations are able to select any algorithm

            Implementations are also responsible for managing how requests and responses are sent
            based on priority; choosing how to avoid head of line blocking for requests; and
            managing the creation of new streams.  Algorithm choices for these could interact with
            any flow control algorithm.

        <section anchor="DisableFlowControl" title="Appropriate Use of Flow Control">
          <t>
            Flow control is defined to protect endpoints that are operating under resource
            constraints.  For example, a proxy needs to share memory between many connections, and
            also might have a slow upstream connection and a fast downstream one.  Flow control
            addresses cases where the receiver is unable process data on one stream, yet wants to
            continue to process other streams in the same connection.
          </t>
          <t>
            Deployments that do not require this capability SHOULD disable flow control for data
            that is being received.  Note that flow control cannot be disabled for sending.  Sending
            data is always subject to the flow control window advertised by the receiver.
          </t>
          <t>
            Deployments with constrained resources (for example, memory) MAY employ flow control to
            limit the amount of memory a peer can consume.  Note, however, that this can lead to
            suboptimal use of available network resources if flow control is enabled without
            knowledge of the bandwidth-delay product (see <xref target="RFC1323"/>).
          </t>
          <t>
            Even with full awareness of the current bandwidth-delay product, implementation of flow
            control can be difficult.  When using flow control, the receive MUST read from the TCP
            receive buffer in a timely fashion.  Failure to do so could lead to a deadlock when
            critical frames, such as <x:ref>WINDOW_UPDATE</x:ref>, are not available to HTTP/2.0.
            However, flow control can ensure that constrained resources are protected without any
            reduction in connection utilization.

      </section>
      
      <section anchor="StreamPriority" title="Stream priority">
        <t>
          The endpoint establishing a new stream can assign a priority for the stream.  Priority is
          represented as an unsigned 31-bit integer.  0 represents the highest priority and
          2<x:sup>31</x:sup>-1 represents the lowest priority.
        </t>
        <t>
          The purpose of this value is to allow an endpoint to express the relative priority of a
          stream.  An endpoint can use this information to preferentially allocate resources to a
          stream.  Within HTTP/2.0, priority can be used to select streams for transmitting frames
          when there is limited capacity for sending.  For instance, an endpoint might enqueue
          frames for all concurrently active streams.  As transmission capacity becomes available,
          frames from higher priority streams might be sent before lower priority streams.
        </t>
        <t>
          Explicitly setting the priority for a stream does not guarantee any particular processing
          or transmision order for the stream relative to any other stream. Nor is there any
          mechanism provided by which the initiator of a stream can force or require a receiving
          endpoint to process concurrent streams in a particular order.

        <t>
          Unless explicitly specified in the <x:ref>HEADERS</x:ref> frame (<xref target="HEADERS"/>)

          <xref target="PushResources">Pushed streams</xref> have a lower priority than their

          </t>
          <t>
            An endpoint that encounters a connection error SHOULD first send a <x:ref>GOAWAY</x:ref>
            frame (<xref target="GOAWAY"/>) with the stream identifier of the last stream that it
            successfully received from its peer.  The <x:ref>GOAWAY</x:ref> frame includes an error
            code that indicates why the connection is terminating.  After sending the
            <x:ref>GOAWAY</x:ref> frame, the endpoint MUST close the TCP connection.
          </t>
          <t>
            It is possible that the <x:ref>GOAWAY</x:ref> will not be reliably received by the
            receiving endpoint.  In the event of a connection error, <x:ref>GOAWAY</x:ref> only

            being terminated.

            An endpoint can end a connection at any time.  In particular, an endpoint MAY choose to

            A <x:ref>RST_STREAM</x:ref> is the last frame that an endpoint can send on a stream.
            The peer that sends the <x:ref>RST_STREAM</x:ref> frame MUST be prepared to receive any
            frames that were sent or enqueued for sending by the remote peer.  These frames can be
            ignored, except where they modify connection state (such as the state maintained for

            it receives frames on a closed stream after more than a round trip time.  This behavior

            If the TCP connection is torn down while streams remain in open or half closed states,

        <t>
          This specification defines a number of frame types, each identified by a unique 8-bit type
          code. Each frame type serves a distinct purpose either in the establishment and management
          of the connection as a whole, or of individual streams.
        </t>
        <t>
          The transmission of specific frame types can alter the state of a connection. If endpoints
          fail to maintain a synchronized view of the connection state, successful communication
          within the connection will no longer be possible. Therefore, it is important that
          endpoints have a shared comprehension of how the state is affected by the use any given
          frame. Accordingly, while it is expected that new frame types will be introduced by
          extensions to this protocol, only frames defined by this document are permitted to alter
          the connection state.
        </t>

        <section anchor="DATA" title="DATA">
          <t>
            DATA frames (type=0x0) convey arbitrary, variable-length sequences of octets associated
            with a stream. One or more DATA frames are used, for instance, to carry HTTP request or
            response payloads.
          </t>
          <t>
            The DATA frame defines the following flags:

              <t hangText="END_STREAM (0x1):">
                Bit 1 being set indicates that this frame is the last that the endpoint will send
                for the identified stream.  Setting this flag causes the stream to enter a <xref
                target="StreamStates">"half closed" or "closed" state</xref>.
              </t>
              <t hangText="RESERVED (0x2):">

            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            DATA frames MUST be associated with a stream. If a DATA frame is received whose stream

          </t>
          <t>
            DATA frames are subject to flow control and can only be sent when a stream is in the
            "open" or "half closed (remote)" states.

            The payload of a <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> includes a "Promised-Stream-ID".  This
            unsigned 31-bit integer identifies the stream the endpoint intends to start sending

            <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> frames MUST be associated with an existing, peer-initiated

                <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                The payload for a complete header block is provided by a sequence of

                frame with the END_PUSH_PROMISE flag set.  Once the sequence terminates, the payload
                of all <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> frames are concatenated and interpreted as a
                single block.

            Recipients of <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> frames can choose to reject promised streams

          </t>
          <t>
            A <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> frame modifies the connection state in two ways.  The
            inclusion of a <xref target="HeaderBlock">header block</xref> potentially modifies the
            compression state.  <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> also reserves a stream for later use,
            causing the promised stream to enter the "reserved" state.  A sender MUST NOT send a
            <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> on a stream unless that stream is either "open" or "half
            closed (remote)"; the sender MUST ensure that the promised stream is a valid choice for
            a <xref target="StreamIdentifiers">new stream identifier</xref> (that is, the promised
            stream MUST be in the "idle" state).
          </t>
          <t>
            Since <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> reserves a stream, ignoring a
            <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> frame causes the stream state to become indeterminate.  A
            receiver MUST treat the receipt of a <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> on a stream that is
            neither "open" nor "half-closed (local)" as a <xref
            target="ConnectionErrorHandler">connection error</xref> of type <x:ref>PROTOCOL_ERROR</x:ref>.
            Similarly, a receiver MUST treat the receipt of a <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> that
            promises an <xref target="StreamIdentifiers">illegal stream identifier</xref> (that is,
            an identifier for a stream that is not currently in the "idle" state) as a <xref

        <section anchor="GOAWAY" title="GOAWAY">
          <t>
            The GOAWAY frame (type=0x7) informs the remote peer to stop creating streams on this
            connection.  It can be sent from the client or the server. Once sent, the sender will
            ignore frames sent on new streams for the remainder of the connection. Receivers of a
            GOAWAY frame MUST NOT open additional streams on the connection, although a new
            connection can be established for new streams.  The purpose of this frame is to allow an
            endpoint to gracefully stop accepting new streams (perhaps for a reboot or maintenance),
            while still finishing processing of previously established streams.
          </t>
          <t>
            There is an inherent race condition between an endpoint starting new streams and the
            remote sending a GOAWAY frame.  To deal with this case, the GOAWAY contains the stream
            identifier of the last stream which was processed on the sending endpoint in this
            connection.  If the receiver of the GOAWAY used streams that are newer than the
            indicated stream identifier, they were not processed by the sender and the receiver may
            treat the streams as though they had never been created at all (hence the receiver may
            want to re-create the streams later on a new connection).
          </t>
          <t>
            Endpoints SHOULD always send a GOAWAY frame before closing a connection so that the
            remote can know whether a stream has been partially processed or not.  For example, if
            an HTTP client sends a POST at the same time that a server closes a connection, the
            client cannot know if the server started to process that POST request if the server does
            not send a GOAWAY frame to indicate where it stopped working.  An endpoint might choose
            to close a connection without sending GOAWAY for misbehaving peers.
          </t>

          <t>
            After sending a GOAWAY frame, the sender can discard frames for new streams.  However,
            any frames that alter connection state cannot be completely ignored.  For instance,
            <x:ref>HEADERS</x:ref>, <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> and <x:ref>CONTINUATION</x:ref>
            frames MUST be minimally processed to ensure a consistent compression state (see <xref
            target="HeaderBlock"/>); similarly DATA frames MUST be counted toward the connection
            flow control window.

            The last stream identifier in the GOAWAY frame contains the highest numbered stream

            have been processed in some way.  The last stream identifier is set to 0 if no streams

            On streams with lower or equal numbered identifiers that were not closed completely

          <t>
            Activity on streams numbered lower or equal to the last stream identifier might still
            complete successfully.  The sender of a GOAWAY frame might gracefully shut down a
            connection by sending a GOAWAY frame, maintaining the connection in an open state until
            all in-progress streams complete.

            even if the frame is in error.  Since the sender counts the frame toward the flow
            control window, if the receiver does not, the flow control window at sender and receiver
            can become different.

          <section title="The Flow Control Window">
            <t>
              Flow control in HTTP/2.0 is implemented using a window kept by each sender on every
              stream. The flow control window is a simple integer value that indicates how many
              bytes of data the sender is permitted to transmit; as such, its size is a measure of
              the buffering capability of the receiver.
            </t>
            <t>
              Two flow control windows are applicable: the stream flow control window and the
              connection flow control window.  The sender MUST NOT send a flow controlled frame with
              a length that exceeds the space available in either of the flow control windows
              advertised by the receiver.  Frames with zero length with the END_STREAM flag set (for
              example, an empty data frame) MAY be sent if there is no available space in either
              flow control window.
            </t>
            <t>
              For flow control calculations, the 8 byte frame header is not counted.
            </t>
            <t>
              After sending a flow controlled frame, the sender reduces the space available in both
              windows by the length of the transmitted frame.
            </t>
            <t>
              The receiver of a frame sends a WINDOW_UPDATE frame as it consumes data and frees up
              space in flow control windows.  Separate WINDOW_UPDATE frames are sent for the stream
              and connection level flow control windows.
            </t>
            <t>
              A sender that receives a WINDOW_UPDATE frame updates the corresponding window by the
              amount specified in the frame.
            </t>
            <t>
              A sender MUST NOT allow a flow control window to exceed 2<x:sup>31</x:sup> - 1 bytes.
              If a sender receives a WINDOW_UPDATE that causes a flow control window to exceed this
              maximum it MUST terminate either the stream or the connection, as appropriate.  For
              streams, the sender sends a <x:ref>RST_STREAM</x:ref> with the error code of
              <x:ref>FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR</x:ref> code; for the connection, a <x:ref>GOAWAY</x:ref>
              frame with a <x:ref>FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR</x:ref> code.
            </t>
            <t>
              Flow controlled frames from the sender and WINDOW_UPDATE frames from the receiver are
              completely asynchronous with respect to each other. This property allows a receiver to
              aggressively update the window size kept by the sender to prevent streams from
              stalling.
            </t>
          </section>

          <section anchor="InitialWindowSize" title="Initial Flow Control Window Size">
            <t>
              When a HTTP/2.0 connection is first established, new streams are created with an
              initial flow control window size of 65535 bytes. The connection flow control window is
              65535 bytes.  Both endpoints can adjust the initial window size for new streams by
              including a value for SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE in the <x:ref>SETTINGS</x:ref>
              frame that forms part of the connection header.
            </t>
            <t>
              Prior to receiving a <x:ref>SETTINGS</x:ref> frame that sets a value for
              SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE, an endpoint can only use the default initial window size
              when sending flow controlled frames.  Similarly, the connection flow control window is
              set to the default initial window size until a WINDOW_UPDATE frame is received.
            </t>
            <t>
              A <x:ref>SETTINGS</x:ref> frame can alter the initial flow control window size for all
              current streams. When the value of SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE changes, a receiver
              MUST adjust the size of all stream flow control windows that it maintains by the
              difference between the new value and the old value. A <x:ref>SETTINGS</x:ref> frame
              cannot alter the connection flow control window.
            </t>
            <t>
              A change to SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE could cause the available space in a flow
              control window to become negative.  A sender MUST track the negative flow control
              window, and MUST NOT send new flow controlled frames until it receives WINDOW_UPDATE
              frames that cause the flow control window to become positive.
            </t>
            <t>
      	      For example, if the client sends 60KB immediately on connection establishment, and the
      	      server sets the initial window size to be 16KB, the client will recalculate the
      	      available flow control window to be -44KB on receipt of the <x:ref>SETTINGS</x:ref>
      	      frame.  The client retains a negative flow control window until WINDOW_UPDATE frames
      	      restore the window to being positive, after which the client can resume sending.
            </t>
          </section>

          <section title="Reducing the Stream Window Size">
            <t>
              A receiver that wishes to use a smaller flow control window than the current size can
              send a new <x:ref>SETTINGS</x:ref> frame.  However, the receiver MUST be prepared to
              receive data that exceeds this window size, since the sender might send data that
              exceeds the lower limit prior to processing the <x:ref>SETTINGS</x:ref> frame.
            </t>
            <t>
              A receiver has two options for handling streams that exceed flow control limits:
              <list style="numbers">
                <t>
                  The receiver can immediately send <x:ref>RST_STREAM</x:ref> with
                  <x:ref>FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR</x:ref> error code for the affected streams.
                </t>
                <t>
                  The receiver can accept the streams and tolerate the resulting head of line
                  blocking, sending WINDOW_UPDATE frames as it consumes data.
                </t>
              </list>
              If a receiver decides to accept streams, both sides MUST recompute the available flow
              control window based on the initial window size sent in the <x:ref>SETTINGS</x:ref>.
            </t>
          </section>

          <section anchor="EndFlowControl" title="Ending Flow Control">
            <t>
              After a receiver reads in a frame that marks the end of a stream (for example, a data
              stream with a END_STREAM flag set), it MUST cease transmission of WINDOW_UPDATE frames
              for that stream. A sender is not obligated to maintain the available flow control
              window for streams that it is no longer sending on.
            </t>
            <t>
              Flow control can be disabled the entire connection using the
              SETTINGS_FLOW_CONTROL_OPTIONS setting.  This setting ends all forms of flow control.
              An implementation that does not wish to perform flow control can use this in the
              initial <x:ref>SETTINGS</x:ref> exchange.
            </t>
            <t>
              Flow control cannot be enabled again once disabled.  Any attempt to re-enable flow
              control - by sending a WINDOW_UPDATE or by clearing the bits on the
              SETTINGS_FLOW_CONTROL_OPTIONS setting - MUST be rejected with a
              <x:ref>FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR</x:ref> error code.

        HTTP/2.0 is intended to be as compatible as possible with current web-based
        applications. This means that, from the perspective of the server business logic or
        application API, the features of HTTP are unchanged. To achieve this, all of the application
        request and response header semantics are preserved, although the syntax of conveying those
        semantics has changed.  Thus, the rules from HTTP/1.1 (<xref target="HTTP-p1"/>, <xref
        target="HTTP-p2"/>, <xref target="HTTP-p4"/>, <xref target="HTTP-p5"/>, <xref

          An HTTP request or response each consist of:

          The last frame in the sequence bears an END_STREAM flag.
        </t>
        <t>
          Other frames MAY be interspersed with these frames, but those frames do not carry HTTP
          semantics.  In particular, <x:ref>HEADERS</x:ref> frames (and any
          <x:ref>CONTINUATION</x:ref> frames that follow) other than the first and optional last

          Trailing header fields are carried in a header block that also terminates the stream.
          That is, a sequence starting with a <x:ref>HEADERS</x:ref> frame, followed by zero or more
          <x:ref>CONTINUATION</x:ref> frames, that carries an END_STREAM flag on the last frame.
          Header blocks after the first that do not terminate the stream are not part of an HTTP
          request or response.

        <t>
          An HTTP request/response exchange fully consumes a single stream.  A request starts with
          the <x:ref>HEADERS</x:ref> frame that puts the stream into an "open" state and ends with a
          frame bearing END_STREAM, which causes the stream to become "half closed" for the client.
          A response starts with a <x:ref>HEADERS</x:ref> frame and ends with a frame bearing
          END_STREAM, which places the stream in the "closed" state.

        <t>
          HTTP/2.0 request and response header fields carry information as a series of key-value
          pairs.  This includes the target URI for the request, the status code for the response, as
          well as HTTP header fields.
        </t>
        <t>
          HTTP header field names are strings of ASCII characters that are compared in a
          case-insensitive fashion.  Note that header compression could cause case information to be
          lost.
        </t>
        <t>
          The semantics of HTTP header fields are not altered by this specification, though header
          fields relating to connection management or request framing are no longer necessary.  An
          HTTP/2.0 request MUST NOT include any of the following header fields: Connection, Host,
          Keep-Alive, Proxy-Connection, TE, Transfer-Encoding, and Upgrade.  A server MUST treat the
          presence of any of these header fields as a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream
          error</xref> of type <x:ref>PROTOCOL_ERROR</x:ref>.

        <section anchor="HttpRequest" title="Request Header Fields">

            HTTP/2.0 defines a number of headers starting with a ':' character that carry
            information about the request target:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>
                The <spanx style="verb">:method</spanx> header field includes the HTTP method (<xref
                target="HTTP-p2" x:fmt="," x:sec="4"/>).
              </t>
              <t>
                The <spanx style="verb">:scheme</spanx> header field includes the scheme portion of
                the target URI (<xref target="RFC3986" x:fmt="," x:sec="3.1"/>).
              </t>
              <t>
                The <spanx style="verb">:host</spanx> header field includes the authority portion of
                the target URI (<xref target="RFC3986" x:fmt="," x:sec="3.2"/>).
              </t>
              <t>
                The <spanx style="verb">:path</spanx> header field includes the path and query parts
                of the target URI (the <spanx style="verb">path-absolute</spanx> production from
                <xref target="RFC3986"/> and optionally a '?' character followed by the <spanx
                style="verb">query</spanx> production, see <xref target="RFC3986" x:fmt=","
                x:sec="3.3"/> and <xref target="RFC3986" x:fmt="," x:sec="3.4"/>).  This field MUST
                NOT be empty; URIs that do not contain a path component MUST include a value of '/',
                unless the request is an OPTIONS request for '*', in which case the <spanx
                style="verb">:path</spanx> header field MUST include '*'.
              </t>
            </list>
            All HTTP/2.0 requests MUST include exactly one valid value for all of these header
            fields.  An intermediary MUST ensure that requests that it forwards are correct.  A
            server MUST treat the absence of any of these header fields, presence of multiple
            values, or an invalid value as a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream error</xref>

            All HTTP Requests that include a body can include a <spanx

            the sum of the <x:ref>DATA</x:ref> frame payload lengths does not equal the value of the
            <spanx style="verb">content-length</spanx> header field, the server MUST return a 400

            field MUST be included in all responses.  An intermediary MUST ensure that it does not
            forward responses with absent or invalid values.  A client MUST treat the absence of the
            <spanx style="verb">:status"</spanx> header field, the presence of multiple values, or
            an invalid value as a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream error</xref> of type

      <section anchor="Reliability" title="Request Reliability Mechanisms in HTTP/2.0">
          <t>
            In HTTP/1.1, an HTTP client is unable to retry a non-idempotent request when an error
            occurs, because there is no means to determine the nature of the error.  It is possible
            that some server processing occurred prior to the error, which could result in
            undesirable effects if the request were reattempted.
          </t>
          <t>
            HTTP/2.0 provides two mechanisms for providing a guarantee to a client that a request
            has not been processed:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>
                The <x:ref>GOAWAY</x:ref> frame indicates the highest stream number that might have
                been processed.  Requests on streams with higher numbers are therefore guaranteed to
                be safe to retry.
              </t>
              <t>
                The <x:ref>REFUSED_STREAM</x:ref> error code can be included in a <x:ref>RST_STREAM</x:ref> frame
                to indicate that the stream is being closed prior to any processing having occurred.
                Any request that was sent on the reset stream can be safely retried.
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            In both cases, clients MAY automatically retry all requests, including those with
            non-idempotent methods.
          </t>
          <t>
            A server MUST NOT indicate that a stream has not been processed unless it can guarantee
            that fact.  If frames that are on a stream are passed to the application layer for any
            stream, then <x:ref>REFUSED_STREAM</x:ref> MUST NOT be used for that stream, and a
            <x:ref>GOAWAY</x:ref> frame MUST include a stream identifier that is greater than or
            equal to the given stream identifier.
          </t>
          <t>
            In addition to these mechanisms, the <x:ref>PING</x:ref> frame provides a way for a
            client to easily test a connection.  Connections that remain idle can become broken as
            some middleboxes (for instance, network address translators, or load balancers) silently
            discard connection bindings.  The <x:ref>PING</x:ref> frame allows a client to safely
            test whether a connection is still active without sending a request.
          </t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="PushResources" title="Server Push">
        <t>
          HTTP/2.0 enables a server to pre-emptively send (or "push") multiple associated resources
          to a client in response to a single request.  This feature becomes particularly helpful
          when the server knows the client will need to have those resources available in order to
          fully process the originally requested resource.
        </t>
        
        <t>
          Pushing additional resources is optional, and is negotiated only between individual
          endpoints.  For instance, an intermediary could receive pushed resources from the server
          but is not required to forward those on to the client.  How to make use of the pushed
          resources is up to that intermediary.  Equally, the intermediary might choose to push
          additional resources to the client, without any action taken by the server.
        </t>

        <section title="Push Requests">
          <t>
            Server push is semantically equivalent to a server responding to a request. The
            <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> frame, or frames, sent by the server includes a header block
            that contains a complete set of request headers that the server attributes to the request.
            It is not possible to push a response to a request that includes a request body.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            Pushed resources are always associated with an explicit request from a client.  The
            <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> frames sent by the server are sent on the stream created for
            the original request.  The <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> frame includes a promised stream
            identifier, chosen from the stream identifiers available to the server (see <xref
            target="StreamIdentifiers"/>).
          </t>

          <t>
            The header fields in <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> and any subsequent
            <x:ref>CONTINUATION</x:ref> frames MUST be a valid and complete set of <xref
            target="HttpRequest">request headers</xref>.  The server MUST include a method in the
            <spanx style="verb">:method</spanx> header field that is safe (see <xref
            target="HTTP-p2" x:fmt="," x:sec="4.2.1"/>).  If a client receives a
            <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> that does not include a complete and valid set of header
            fields, or the <spanx style="verb">:method</spanx> header field identifies a method that
            is not safe, it MUST respond with a <xref target="StreamErrorHandler">stream
            error</xref> of type <x:ref>PROTOCOL_ERROR</x:ref>.
          </t>

          <t>
            The server SHOULD send <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> (<xref target="PUSH_PROMISE"/>) frames
            prior to sending any frames that reference
            the promised resources.  This avoids a race where clients issue requests for resources
            prior to receiving any <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> frames.
          </t>
          <t>
            For example, if the server receives a request for a document containing embedded links to
            multiple image files, and the server chooses to push those additional images to the
            client, sending push promises before the <x:ref>DATA</x:ref> frames that contain the image
            links ensure that the client is able to see the promises before discovering the resources.
            Similarly, if the server pushes resources referenced by the header block (for instance, in
            Link header fields), sending the push promises before sending the header block ensures
            that clients do not request those resources.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> frames MUST NOT be sent by the client.
            <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> frames can be sent by the server on any stream that was
            opened by the client.  They MUST be sent on a stream that is in either the "open" or
            "half closed (remote)" to the server.  <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> frames are
            interspersed with the frames that comprise a response, though they cannot be
            interspersed with <x:ref>HEADERS</x:ref> and <x:ref>CONTINUATION</x:ref> frames that
            comprise a single header block.
          </t>
        </section>
        
        <section title="Push Responses">
          <t>
            After sending the <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> frame, the server can begin delivering the
            pushed resource as a <xref target="HttpResponse">response</xref> on a server-initiated
            stream that uses the promised stream identifier.  The server uses this stream to transmit
            an HTTP response, using the same sequence of frames as defined in <xref
            target="HttpSequence"/>.  This stream becomes <xref target="StreamStates">"half closed" to
            the client</xref> after the initial <x:ref>HEADERS</x:ref> frame is sent.
          </t>

          <t>
            Once a client receives a <x:ref>PUSH_PROMISE</x:ref> frame and chooses to accept the
            pushed resource, the client SHOULD NOT issue any requests for the promised resource until
            after the promised stream has closed.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            If the client determines, for any reason, that it does not wish to receive the pushed
            resource from the server, or if the server takes too long to begin sending the promised
            resource, the client can send an <x:ref>RST_STREAM</x:ref> frame, using either the
            <x:ref>CANCEL</x:ref> or <x:ref>REFUSED_STREAM</x:ref> codes, and referencing the pushed
            stream's identifier.
          </t>
          <t>
            A client can use the SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS setting to limit the number of
            resources that can be concurrently pushed by a server.  Advertising a
            SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS value of zero disables server push by preventing the
            server from creating the necessary streams.  This does not prohibit a server from
            sending PUSH_PROMISE frames; clients need to reset any promised streams that are not
            wanted.
          </t>

    <section anchor="HttpExtra" title="Additional HTTP Requirements/Considerations">
      <t>
        This section outlines attributes of the HTTP protocol that improve interoperability, reduce
        exposure to known security vulnerabilities, or reduce the potential for implementation
        variation.
      </t>

      <section title="Connection Management">
        <t>
          HTTP/2.0 connections are persistent.  For best performance, it is expected clients will
          not close connections until it is determined that no further communication with a server
          is necessary (for example, when a user navigates away from a particular web page), or
          until the server closes the connection.
        </t>
        <t>
          Clients SHOULD NOT open more than one HTTP/2.0 connection to a given origin (<xref
          target="RFC6454"/>) concurrently.  A client can create additional connections as
          replacements, either to replace connections that are near to exhausting the available
          <xref target="StreamIdentifiers">stream identifiers</xref>, or to replace connections that
          have encountered <xref target="ConnectionErrorHandler">errors</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Servers are encouraged to maintain open connections for as long as possible, but are
          permitted to terminate idle connections if necessary.  When either endpoint chooses to
          close the transport-level TCP connection, the terminating endpoint MUST first send a
          <x:ref>GOAWAY</x:ref> (<xref target="GOAWAY"/>) frame so that both endpoints can reliably determine whether
          previously sent frames have been processed and gracefully complete or terminate any
          necessary remaining tasks.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Use of TLS Features">
        <t>
          Implementations of HTTP/2.0 MUST support <xref target="TLS11">TLS 1.1</xref>.  <cref>The
          working group intends to require at least the use of <xref target="TLS12">TLS 1.2</xref>
          prior to publication of this document; negotiating TLS 1.1 is permitted to enable the
          creation of interoperable implementations of early drafts.</cref>
        </t>
        <t>
          The TLS implementation MUST support the <xref target="TLS-EXT">Server Name Indication
          (SNI)</xref> extension to TLS. HTTP/2.0 clients MUST indicate the target domain name when
          negotiating TLS.
        </t>
        <t>
          A server that receives a TLS handshake that does not include either TLS 1.1 or SNI, MUST
          NOT negotiate HTTP/2.0.  Removing HTTP/2.0 protocols from consideration could result in
          the removal of all protocols from the set of protocols offered by the client.  This causes
          protocol negotiation failure, as described in Section 3.2 of <xref target="TLSALPN"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Implementations are encouraged not to negotiate TLS cipher suites with known
          vulnerabilities, such as <xref target="RC4"/>.
        </t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Frame Size Limits for HTTP">
        <t>
          Frames used for HTTP messages MUST NOT exceed 2<x:sup>14</x:sup>-1 (16383) octets in
          length, not counting the 8 octet frame header. An endpoint MUST treat the receipt of a
          larger frame as a <x:ref>FRAME_TOO_LARGE</x:ref> error (see <xref target="FrameSize"/>).
        </t>
      </section>
      
      <section anchor="Compression" title="GZip Content-Encoding">
        <t>
          Clients MUST support gzip compression for HTTP response bodies.  Regardless of the value
          of the accept-encoding header field, a server MAY send responses with gzip or deflate
          encoding.  A compressed response MUST still bear an appropriate content-encoding header
          field.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <section title="Server Authority and Same-Origin">
        <t>
          This specification uses the same-origin policy (<xref target="RFC6454" x:fmt=","
          x:sec="3"/>) to determine whether an origin server is permitted to provide content.
        </t>
        <t>
          A server that is contacted using TLS is authenticated based on the certificate that it
          offers in the TLS handshake (see <xref target="RFC2818" x:fmt="," x:sec="3"/>).  A server
          is considered authoritative for an "https" resource if it has been successfully
          authenticated for the domain part of the origin of the resource that it is providing.
        </t>
        <t>
          A server is considered authoritative for an "http" resource if the connection is
          established to a resolved IP address for the domain in the origin of the resource.
        </t>
        <t>
          A client MUST NOT use, in any way, resources provided by a server that is not
          authoritative for those resources.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Cross-Protocol Attacks">
        <t>
          When using TLS, we believe that HTTP/2.0 introduces no new cross-protocol attacks.  TLS
          encrypts the contents of all transmission (except the handshake itself), making it
          difficult for attackers to control the data which could be used in a cross-protocol
          attack.  <cref>Issue: This is no longer true</cref>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Cacheability of Pushed Resources">
        <t>
          Pushed resources are responses without an explicit request; the request for a pushed
          resource is synthesized from the request that triggered the push, plus resource
          identification information provided by the server.  Request header fields are necessary
          for HTTP cache control validations (such as the Vary header field) to work.  For this
          reason, caches MUST inherit request header fields from the associated stream for the push.
          This includes the Cookie header field.
        </t>
        <t>
          Caching resources that are pushed is possible, based on the guidance provided by the
          origin server in the Cache-Control header field.  However, this can cause issues if a
          single server hosts more than one tenant.  For example, a server might offer multiple
          users each a small portion of its URI space.
        </t>
        <t>
          Where multiple tenants share space on the same server, that server MUST ensure that
          tenants are not able to push representations of resources that they do not have authority
          over.  Failure to enforce this would allow a tenant to provide a representation that would
          be served out of cache, overriding the actual representation that the authoritative tenant
          provides.
        </t>
        <t>
          Pushed resources for which an origin server is not authoritative are never cached or used.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Privacy Considerations">
        <t>
          HTTP/2.0 aims to keep connections open longer between clients and servers in order to
          reduce the latency when a user makes a request.  The maintenance of these connections over
          time could be used to expose private information.  For example, a user using a browser
          hours after the previous user stopped using that browser may be able to learn about what
          the previous user was doing.  This is a problem with HTTP in its current form as well,
          however the short lived connections make it less of a risk.
        </t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
        This document establishes registries for frame types, error codes and settings.  These new
        registries are entered in a new "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 2.0 Parameters" section.
      </t>

          registry operates under the <xref target="RFC5226">"IETF Review" policy</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Frame types are an 8-bit value.  When reviewing new frame type registrations, special
          attention is advised for any frame type-specific flags that are defined.  Frame flags can
          interact with existing flags and could prevent the creation of globally applicable flags.
