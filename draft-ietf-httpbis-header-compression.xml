                This document describes HPACK, a format adapted to efficiently
                represent HTTP header fields in the context of HTTP/2.0 (see
                <xref target="HTTP2"/>).

        <section title="Overview" anchor="overview">
            <t>
                In HTTP/1.X (see <xref target="HTTP-p1"/>), header fields are
                sent without any form of compression.  As web pages have grown
                to include dozens to hundreds of requests, the redundant
                header fields in these requests now pose a problem of
                measurable latency and unnecessary bandwidth (see <xref
                    target="PERF1"/> and <xref target="PERF2"/>).
            </t>

            <t>
                <xref target="SPDY">SPDY</xref> initially addressed this
                redundancy by compressing header fields with Deflate, which
                proved very effective at eliminating the redundant header
                fields.  However, that aproach exposed a security risk as
                demonstrated by the <xref target="CRIME">CRIME</xref>.
            </t>

            <t>
                In this document, we propose a new compressor for header
                fields which eliminates redundant header fields, is not
                vulnerable to CRIME style attacks, and which also has a
                bounded memory cost for use in constrained environments.
            </t>

            <section title="Outline">
                <t>
                    The HTTP header field encoding described in this document
                    is based on a header table that map (name, value) pairs to
                    index values.  Header tables are incrementally updated
                    during the HTTP/2.0 session.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The encoder is responsible for deciding which header
                    fields to insert as new entries in the header table.  The
                    decoder then does exactly what the encoder prescribes,
                    ending in a state that exactly matches the encoder's
                    state.  This enables decoders to remain simple and
                    understand a wide variety of encoders.
                </t>
                <t>
                    As two consecutive sets of header fields often have header
                    fields in common, each set of header fields is coded as a
                    difference from the previous set of header fields. The
                    goal is to only encode the changes (header fields present
                    in one of the set and not in the other) between the two
                    sets of header fields.
                </t>
                <t>
                    An example illustrating the use of these different
                    mechanisms to represent header fields is available in
                    <xref target="example"/>.

                    The encoding and decoding of header fields relies on some

                            value to be either a value as specified by
                            HTTP/1.X (see <xref target="HTTP-p1"/>), or a

                        A header table consists of a list of header fields
                        maintained in first-in, first-out order.
                        The first and newest entry in a header table is always
                        at index 0, and the oldest entry of a header table is
                        at the index len(header table)-1.

                        There is typically no need for the header table to
                        contain duplicate entries. However, duplicate entries

                        header table. To limit the memory requirements on the
                        decoder side, the header table size is strictly

                    <t>
                        The emission of a header field is the process of
                        passing that header field to the application, so that
                        the application can process and react to header field
                        data.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        By emitting header fields instead of emitting header
                        sets, the decoder can be implemented in a streaming
                        way, and as such must only keep in memory the header
                        table and the reference set. This bounds the amount of
                        memory used by the decoder, even in presence of a very
                        large set of header fields. The management of memory
                        for handling very large sets of header fields can
                        therefore be deferred to the application.

                    <t>
                        When a header field is a NULL-separated list of values,
                        each value within the list MAY be emitted separately,
                        with the same header field name, and the order of
                        emission MUST be the order of appearance in the list.

                        Integers are used to represent name indexes, pair
                        indexes or string lengths. To allow for optimized
                        processing, an integer representation always finishes
                        at the end of a byte.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        An integer is represented in two parts: a prefix that
                        fills the current byte and an optional list of bytes
                        that are used if the integer value does not fit within
                        the prefix.  The number of bits of the prefix (called
                        N) is a parameter of the integer representation.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The N-bit prefix allows filling the current byte.  If
                        the value is small enough (strictly less than
                        2<x:sup>N</x:sup>-1), it is encoded within the N-bit
                        prefix.  Otherwise all the bits of the prefix are set
                        to 1 and the value is encoded using an <eref
                            target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_quantity">
                            unsigned variable length integer</eref>
                        representation. N is always between 1 and 8 bits. An
                        integer starting at a byte-boundary will have an 8-bit
                        prefix.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The algorithm to represent an integer I is as follows:
                        <figure><artwork type = "inline"><![CDATA[
If I < 2^N - 1, encode I on N bits
Else
    encode 2^N - 1 on N bits
    I = I - (2^N - 1)
    While I >= 128
         Encode (I % 128 + 128) on 8 bits
         I = I / 128
    encode (I) on 8 bits
]]></artwork></figure>
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        This integer representation allows for values of
                        indefinite size.  It is also possible for an encoder to
                        send a large number of zero values, which can waste
                        bytes and could be used to overflow integer values.
                        Excessively large integer encodings - in value or octet
                        length - MUST be treated as a decoding error.  Different
                        limits can be set for each of the different uses of
                        integers, based on implementation constraints.

        <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
                This compressor exists to solve security issues present in
                stream compressors such as DEFLATE whereby the compression
                context can be efficiently probed to reveal secrets.
                A conformant implementation of this specification should be
                fairly safe against that kind of attack, as the reaping of any
                information from the compression context requires more work than
                guessing and verifying the plaintext data directly with the
                server.  As with any secret, however, the longer the length
                of the secret, the more difficult the secret is to guess. It
                is inadvisable to have short cookies that are relied upon to
                remain secret for any duration of time.
            </t>
            <t>
                A proper security-conscious implementation will also need to
                prevent timing attacks by ensuring that the amount of time it
                takes to do string comparisons is always a function of the
                total length of the strings, and not a function of the number
                of matched characters.
            </t>
            <t>
                A decoder needs to ensure that larger values or encodings of
                integers do not permit exploitation.  Decoders MUST limit the
                size of integers, both in value and encoded length, that it
                accepts (see <xref target="integer.representation"/>).
            </t>
            <t>
                Another common security problem is when the remote endpoint
                successfully causes the local endpoint to exhaust its memory.
                This compressor attempts to deal with the most obvious ways
                that this could occur by limiting both the peak and the
                steady-state amount of memory consumed in the compressor
                state, by providing ways for the application to consume/flush
                the emitted header fields in small chunks, and by considering
                overhead in the state size calculation.  Implementors must
                still be careful in the creation of APIs to an implementation
                of this compressor by ensuring that header field keys and
                values are either emitted as a stream, or that the compression
                implementation have a limit on the maximum size of a key or
                value. Failure to implement these kinds of safeguards may
                still result in a scenario where the local endpoint exhausts
                its memory.

                            Set.  Changed x-my-header to mynewheader. Added
                            text in the HeaderEmission section indicating that

                The static table consists of an unchangable ordered list of
                (name, value) pairs. The first entry in the table is always
                represented by the index len(header table), and the last entry
                in the table is represented by the index len(header
                table)+len(static table)-1.

            <t>
                <cref>
                    The ordering of these tables is currently arbitrary.
                    The tables in this section should be updated and ordered
                    such that the table entries with the smallest indices are
                    those which, based on a statistical analysis of the
                    frequency of use weighted by size, achieve the largest
                    decrease in bytes transmitted subject to HTTP 2.0 header
                    field
                    rules (like removal of some header fields). This set of header fields
                    is currently very likely incomplete, and should be made
                    complete.

                The full index of each entry, to be used for encoding a
                reference to this entry, is computed by adding the number of
                entries in the header table to this index.

                    This table is out of date and needs updating.
                    In particular, EOS needs to be at least 7-bits long
                    and currently is not.

                    This table is out of date and needs updating.
                    In particular, EOS needs to be at least 7-bits long
                    and currently is not.
