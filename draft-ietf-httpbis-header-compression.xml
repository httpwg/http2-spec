                This document describes HPACK, a format adapted to efficiently
                represent HTTP header fields in the context of HTTP/2.0 (see <xref
                    target="HTTP2"/>).

        <section title="Overview" anchor="overview">
            <t>
                In HTTP/1.X, header fields are sent without any form of
                compression.  As web pages have grown to include dozens to
                hundreds of requests, the redundant header fields in these
                requests now pose a problem of measurable latency and
                unnecessary bandwidth (see <xref target="PERF1"/> and <xref
                    target="PERF2"/>).
            </t>

            <t>
                <xref target="SPDY">SPDY</xref> initially addressed this
                redundancy by compressing header fields with Deflate, which
                proved very effective at eliminating the redundant header
                fields.  However, that aproach exposed a security risk as
                demonstrated by the <xref target="CRIME">CRIME</xref>.
            </t>

            <t>
                In this document, we propose a new compressor for headers
                which eliminates redundant headers, is not vulnerable to CRIME
                style attacks, and which also has a bounded memory cost for
                use in constrained environments.
            </t>

            <section title="Outline">
                <t>
                    The HTTP header field encoding described in this document
                    is based on a header table that map (name, value) pairs to
                    index values.  Header tables are incrementally updated
                    during the HTTP/2.0 session.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The encoder is responsible for deciding which header
                    fields to insert as new entries in the header table.  The
                    decoder then does exactly what the encoder prescribes,
                    ending in a state that exactly matches the encoder's
                    state.  This enables decoders to remain simple and
                    understand a wide variety of encoders.
                </t>
                <t>
                    As two consecutive sets of header fields often have header
                    fields in common, each set of header fields is coded as a
                    difference from the previous set of header fields. The
                    goal is to only encode the changes (header fields present
                    in one of the set and not in the other) between the two
                    sets of header fields.
                </t>
                <t>
                    An example illustrating the use of these different
                    mechanisms to represent header fields is available in
                    <xref target="example"/>.

                    The encoding and decoding of headers relies on some
                    components and concepts:

                            to associate stored header fields to index values.
                            The data stored in this table is in first-in,

                            entries in the header table or static table.
                            This is used for the differential encoding of a new

                        other direction, there is one encoding context for

                        A header table consists of a list of header fields
                        maintained in first-in, first-out order.
                        The first and newest entry in a header table is always
                        at index 0, and the oldest entry of a header table is
                        at the index len(header table)-1.

                    <t>
                        There is typically no need for the header table to
                        contain duplicate entries. However, duplicate entries
                        MUST NOT be treated as an error by a decoder.

                    <t>
                        The encoder decides how to update the header table and
                        as such can control how much memory is used by the
                        header table. To limit the memory requirements on the
                        decoder side, the header table size is strictly
                        bounded (see <xref target="maximum.table.size"/>).

                        The header table is updated during the processing of

                        The emission of header field is the process of passing
                        that header field to the application, so that the
                        application can process and react to header field data.

                    <t>
                        By emitting headers instead of emitting header sets,
                        the decoder may be implemented in a streaming way, and
                        as such must only keep in memory the header table and
                        the reference set. This bounds the amount of memory
                        used by the decoder, even in presence of a very large
                        set of header fields. The management of memory for
                        handling very large sets of header fields can
                        therefore be deferred to the application.

                    <t>
                        When a header field includes a value-list which
                        has a NULL, each value within the value-list
                        may be emitted with the name separately in the
                        order in which it appears in the value-list.

                        Integers are used to represent name indexes, pair
                        indexes or string lengths. To allow for optimized
                        processing, an integer representation always finishes
                        at the end of a byte.

                    <t>
                        An integer is represented in two parts: a prefix that
                        fills the current byte and an optional list of bytes
                        that are used if the integer value does not fit in the
                        prefix.  The number of bits of the prefix (called N)
                        is a parameter of the integer representation.

                    <t>
                        The N-bit prefix allows filling the current byte.  If

                        2<x:sup>N</x:sup>-1), it is encoded within the N-bit
                        prefix.  Otherwise all the bits of the prefix are set
                        to 1 and the value is encoded using an <eref

            <t>
                This compressor exists to solve security issues present in
                stream compressors such as DEFLATE whereby the compression
                context can be efficiently probed to reveal secrets.
                A conformant implementation of this specification should be
                fairly safe against that kind of attack, as the reaping of any
                information from the compression context requires more work than
                guessing and verifying the plaintext data directly with the
                server.  As with any secret, however, the longer the length
                of the secret, the more difficult the secret is to guess. It
                is inadvisable to have short cookies that are relied upon to
                remain secret for any duration of time.
            </t>
            <t>
                A proper security-conscious implementation will also need to
                prevent timing attacks by ensuring that the amount of time it
                takes to do string comparisons is always a function of the
                total length of the strings, and not a function of the number
                of matched characters.
            </t>
            <t>
                Another common security problem is when the remote endpoint
                successfully causes the local endpoint to exhaust its memory.
                This compressor attempts to deal with the most obvious ways
                that this could occur by limiting both the peak and the
                steady-state amount of memory consumed in the compressor
                state, by providing ways for the application to consume/flush
                the emitted header fields in small chunks, and by considering
                overhead in the state size calculation.  Implementors must
                still be careful in the creation of APIs to an implementation
                of this compressor by ensuring that header field keys and
                values are either emitted as a stream, or that the compression
                implementation have a limit on the maximum size of a key or
                value. Failure to implement these kinds of safeguards may
                still result in a scenario where the local endpoint exhausts
                its memory.

                The static table consists of an unchangable ordered list of
                (name, value) pairs. The first entry in the table is always
                represented by the index len(header table), and the last entry

                    The ordering of these tables is currently arbitrary.
                    The tables in this section should be updated and ordered
                    such that the table entries with the smallest indices are
                    those which, based on a statistical analysis of the
                    frequency of use weighted by size, achieve the largest
                    decrease in bytes transmitted subject to HTTP 2.0 header
                    rules (like removal of some headers). This set of headers
                    is currently very likely incomplete, and should be made

                Here is an example that illustrates different representations
                and how tables are updated.
                <cref>This section needs to be updated to better reflect the
                    new processing of header fields, and include more
                    examples.</cref>
            </t>
            <section title="First header set">
                <t>
                    The first header set to represent is the following:
                    <figure><artwork type="message/http">
:path, /my-example/index.html
user-agent, my-user-agent
mynewheader, first
</artwork></figure>
                    The header table is empty, all header fields are
                    represented as literal header fields with indexing.  The
                    'mynewheader' header field name is not in the header table
                    and is encoded literally.  This gives the following
                    representation:
                    <figure><artwork type="message/http">
0x04      (literal header with incremental indexing, name index = 3)
0x16      (header field value string length = 22)
/my-example/index.html
0x0D      (literal header with incremental indexing, name index = 12)
0x0D      (header field value string length = 13)
my-user-agent
0x00      (literal header with incremental indexing, new name)
0x0B      (header field name string length = 11)
mynewheader
0x05      (header field value string length = 5)
first
</artwork></figure>
                    The header table is as follows after the processing of
                    these header fields:
                    <figure><artwork type="inline">

                    As all the header fields in the first header set are
                    indexed in the header table, all are kept in the reference
                    set of header fields, which is:
                    <figure><artwork type="inline">
Reference Set:

mynewheader, first

            <section title="Second header set">
                <t>
                    The second header set to represent is the following:
                    <figure><artwork type="message/http">
:path, /my-example/resources/script.js
user-agent, my-user-agent
mynewheader, second
</artwork></figure>
                    Comparing this second header set to the reference set, the
                    first and third header fields are from the reference set
                    are not present in this second header set and must be
                    removed. In addition, in this new set, the first and third
                    header fields have to be encoded.  The path header field
                    is represented as a literal header field without indexing.
                    The mynewheader will be represented as a literal header
                    field with incremental indexing.
                    <figure><artwork type="message/http">
0x80       (indexed header, index = 0: removal from reference set)

                    The header table is updated as follow:

                    All the header fields in this second header set are
                    indexed in the header table, therefore, all are kept in
                    the reference set of header fields, which becomes:
