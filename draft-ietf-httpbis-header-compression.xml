        <section title="Overview" anchor="overview">
            <t>
                In HTTP (see <xref target="HTTP-p1"/>), header fields are
                sent without any form of compression.  As web pages have grown
                to include dozens to hundreds of requests, the redundant
                header fields in these requests now pose a problem of
                measurable latency and unnecessary bandwidth (see <xref
                    target="PERF1"/> and <xref target="PERF2"/>).
            </t>

            <t>
                <xref target="SPDY">SPDY</xref> initially addressed this
                redundancy by compressing header fields with Deflate, which
                proved very effective at eliminating the redundant header
                fields.  However, that approach exposed a security risk as
                demonstrated by the <xref target="CRIME">CRIME</xref>.
            </t>

            <t>
                This document describes HPACK, a new compressor for header
                fields which eliminates redundant header fields, is not
                vulnerable to known security attacks, and which also has a
                bounded memory cost for use in constrained environments.
            </t>

            <section title="Outline">
                <t>
                    The HTTP header field encoding described in this document
                    is based on a header table that map name-value pairs to
                    index values.  Header tables are incrementally updated
                    during the HTTP/2.0 session.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The encoder is responsible for deciding which header
                    fields to insert as new entries in the header table.  The
                    decoder then does exactly what the encoder prescribes,
                    ending in a state that exactly matches the encoder's
                    state.  This enables decoders to remain simple and
                    understand a wide variety of encoders.
                </t>
                <t>
                    As two consecutive sets of header fields often have header
                    fields in common, each set of header fields is coded as a
                    difference from the previous set of header fields. The
                    goal is to only encode the changes (header fields present
                    in one of the set and not in the other) between the two
                    sets of header fields.
                </t>
                <t>
                    HTTP header field compression treats a set of header fields
                    as an unordered collection of name-value pairs.  Names and
                    values are opaque sequences of octets.  The order of header
                    fields is not guaranteed to be preserved after being
                    compressed and decompressed.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Examples illustrating the use of these different
                    mechanisms to represent header fields are available in
                    <xref target="examples"/>.

                    The encoding and decoding of header fields relies on some
                    components and concepts:

                            entries in the header table.  This is used for the

                        Using HTTP, messages are exchanged between a client

                        A header table consists of a list of header fields
                        maintained in first-in, first-out order.
                        The first and newest entry in a header table is always
                        at index 1, and the oldest entry of a header table is
                        at the index len(header table).

                    <t>
                        There is typically no need for the header table to
                        contain duplicate entries. However, duplicate entries
                        MUST NOT be treated as an error by a decoder.

                        The encoder decides how to update the header table and
                        as such can control how much memory is used by the
                        header table. To limit the memory requirements on the
                        decoder side, the header table size is strictly
                        bounded (see <xref target="maximum.table.size"/>).

                        The reference set enables differential encoding,
                        whereby only differences between the previous header
                        set and the current header set need to be encoded. The
                        use of differential encoding is optional for any
                        header set.

                    <t>
                        When an entry is evicted from the header table, if it
                        was referenced from the reference set, its reference
                        is removed from the reference set.

                        To limit the memory requirements on the decoder side

                        the header table can be contained in the reference

                        of the static table, this entry is inserted into the

                    <t>
                        The emission of a header field is the process of
                        marking a header field as belonging to the current
                        header set. Once a header has been emitted, it cannot
                        be removed from the current header set.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        On the decoding side, an emitted header field can be
                        safely passed to the upper processing layer as part of
                        the current header set. The decoder MAY pass the
                        emitted header fields to the upper processing layer in
                        any order.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        By emitting header fields instead of emitting header
                        sets, the decoder can be implemented in a streaming
                        way, and as such has only to keep in memory the header
                        table and the reference set. This bounds the amount of
                        memory used by the decoder, even in presence of a very
                        large set of header fields. The management of memory
                        for handling very large sets of header fields can
                        therefore be deferred to the upper processing layers.

                        Integers are used to represent name indexes, pair
                        indexes or string lengths. To allow for optimized
                        processing, an integer representation always finishes
                        at the end of an octet.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        An integer is represented in two parts: a prefix that
                        fills the current octet and an optional list of octets
                        that are used if the integer value does not fit within
                        the prefix.  The number of bits of the prefix (called
                        N) is a parameter of the integer representation.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The N-bit prefix allows filling the current octet.  If
                        the value is small enough (strictly less than
                        2<x:sup>N</x:sup>-1), it is encoded within the N-bit
                        prefix.  Otherwise all the bits of the prefix are set
                        to 1 and the value is encoded using an <eref
                            target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_quantity">
                            unsigned variable length integer</eref>
                        representation. N is always between 1 and 8 bits. An
                        integer starting at an octet-boundary will have an 8-bit
                        prefix.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The algorithm to represent an integer I is as follows:
                        <figure><artwork type = "inline"><![CDATA[
If I < 2^N - 1, encode I on N bits
Else
    encode 2^N - 1 on N bits
    I = I - (2^N - 1)
    While I >= 128
         Encode (I % 128 + 128) on 8 bits
         I = I / 128
    encode (I) on 8 bits
]]></artwork></figure>
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        This integer representation allows for values of
                        indefinite size.  It is also possible for an encoder to
                        send a large number of zero values, which can waste
                        octets and could be used to overflow integer values.
                        Excessively large integer encodings - in value or octet
                        length - MUST be treated as a decoding error.  Different
                        limits can be set for each of the different uses of
                        integers, based on implementation constraints.

            <t>
                This compressor exists to solve security issues present in
                stream compressors such as DEFLATE whereby the compression
                context can be efficiently probed to reveal secrets.
                A conformant implementation of this specification should be
                fairly safe against that kind of attack, as the reaping of any
                information from the compression context requires more work than
                guessing and verifying the plain text data directly with the
                server.  As with any secret, however, the longer the length
                of the secret, the more difficult the secret is to guess. It
                is inadvisable to have short cookies that are relied upon to
                remain secret for any duration of time.
            </t>
            <t>
                A proper security-conscious implementation will also need to
                prevent timing attacks by ensuring that the amount of time it
                takes to do string comparisons is always a function of the
                total length of the strings, and not a function of the number
                of matched characters.
            </t>
            <t>
                A decoder needs to ensure that larger values or encodings of
                integers do not permit exploitation.  Decoders MUST limit the
                size of integers, both in value and encoded length, that it
                accepts (see <xref target="integer.representation"/>).
            </t>
            <t>
                Another common security problem is when the remote endpoint
                successfully causes the local endpoint to exhaust its memory.
                This compressor attempts to deal with the most obvious ways
                that this could occur by limiting both the peak and the
                steady-state amount of memory consumed in the compressor
                state, by providing ways for the application to consume/flush
                the emitted header fields in small chunks, and by considering
                overhead in the state size calculation.  Implementors must
                still be careful in the creation of APIs to an implementation
                of this compressor by ensuring that header field keys and
                values are either emitted as a stream, or that the compression
                implementation have a limit on the maximum size of a key or
                value. Failure to implement these kinds of safeguards may
                still result in a scenario where the local endpoint exhausts
                its memory.

                The static table consists of an unchangeable ordered list of
                (name, value) pairs. The first entry in the table is always
                represented by the index len(header table)+1, and the last entry
                in the table is represented by the index len(header
                table)+len(static table).

                    The ordering of these tables is currently arbitrary.
                    The tables in this section should be updated and ordered
                    such that the table entries with the smallest indices are

                The following Huffman codes are used when encoding string
                literals in the server to client direction. These codes apply
                for both responses to client requests and for push-promises.

        <t>
            Several header fields are evicted from the header table during the
processing of this header set. Before evicting a header belonging to the
reference set, it is emitted, by coding it twice as an Indexed Representation.
The first representation removes the header field from the reference set, the
second one adds it again to the reference set, also emitting it.

    <t>
        This section shows the same examples as the previous section, but
using Huffman encoding for the literal values. The eviction mechanism uses the
length of the decoded literal values, so the same evictions occurs as in the
previous section.

            Several header fields are evicted from the header table during the
processing of this header set. Before evicting a header belonging to the
reference set, it is emitted, by coding it twice as an Indexed Representation.
The first representation removes the header field from the reference set, the
second one adds it again to the reference set, also emitting it.
