        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>
                In HTTP/1.1 (see <xref target="RFC7230"/>), header fields are
                not compressed. As Web pages have grown to require dozens to
                hundreds of requests, the redundant header fields in these
                requests unnecessarily consume bandwidth, measurably increasing
                latency.
            </t>

            <t>
                <xref target="SPDY">SPDY</xref> initially addressed this
                redundancy by compressing header fields using the <xref
                    target="DEFLATE">DEFLATE</xref> format, which proved very
                effective at efficiently representing the redundant header
                fields.  However, that approach exposed a security risk as
                demonstrated by the CRIME attack (see <xref target="CRIME"/>).
            </t>

            <t>
                This specification defines HPACK, a new compressor for header
                fields which eliminates redundant header fields, limits
                vulnerability to known security attacks, and which has a bounded
                memory requirement for use in constrained environments.
            </t>

            <t>
                The HPACK format is intentionally simple and inflexible.  Both
                characteristics reduce the risk of interoperability or security
                issues based by implementation error.  No extensibility
                mechanisms are defined; changes to the format are only possible
                by defining a complete replacement.
            </t>

            <section title="Overview">
                <t>
                    The format defined in this specification treats a list of
                    header fields as an ordered collection of name-value pairs
                    that can include duplicates. Names and values are
                    considered to be opaque sequences of octets, and the order
                    of header fields is preserved after being compressed and
                    decompressed.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Encoding is informed by header tables that map
                    name-value pairs to indexed values. These header tables can
                    be incrementally updated as new pairs are encoded or
                    decoded.
                </t>
                <t>
                    In the encoded form, a header field is represented either
                    literally or as a reference to a name-value pair in one of
                    the header tables. Therefore, a list of header fields can be
                    encoded using a mixture of references and literal values.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The encoder is responsible for deciding which header fields
                    to insert as new entries in the header tables.  The decoder
                    executes the modifications to the header tables prescribed
                    by the encoder, reconstructing the list of header fields in
                    the process.  This enables decoders to remain simple and
                    interoperate with a wide variety of encoders.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Examples illustrating the use of these different mechanisms
                    to represent header fields are available in <xref

                This specification does not describe a specific algorithm for an
                encoder.  Instead, it defines precisely how a decoder is
                expected to operate, allowing encoders to produce any encoding
                that this definition permits.

                    HPACK preserves the ordering of header fields inside the
                    header list. An encoder MUST order header field
                    representations in the header block according to their
                    ordering in the original header list. A decoder MUST
                    order header fields in the decoded header list according to
                    their ordering in the header block.

                <t>
                    To decompress header blocks, a decoder only needs to
                    maintain a dynamic table (see <xref
                        target="dynamic.table"/>) as a decoding context. No

                <t>
                    When used for bidirectional communication, such as in HTTP,
                    the encoding and decoding dynamic tables maintained by an
                    endpoint are completely independent. I.e., the request

                    HPACK uses two tables for associating header fields to
                    indexes. The static table (see <xref
                        target="static.table"/>) is predefined and contains
                    common header fields (most of them with an empty value). The
                    dynamic table (see <xref target="dynamic.table"/>) is
                    dynamic and can be used by the encoder to index header
                    fields repeated in the encoded header lists.
                </t>
                <t>
                    These two tables are combined into a single address space
                    for defining index values (see <xref

                        newest entry in a dynamic table is at the lowest index,
                        and the oldest entry of a dynamic table is at the

                        The dynamic table is initially empty.  Entries are added

                    <t>
                        The dynamic table can contain duplicate entries.
                        Therefore, duplicate entries MUST NOT be treated as an
                        error by a decoder.

                        The encoder decides how to update the dynamic table and
                        as such can control how much memory is used by the
                        dynamic table. To limit the memory requirements of the
                        decoder, the dynamic table size is strictly bounded (see

                    An encoded header field can be represented either as a
                    literal or as an index.

                <t>
                    A literal representation defines a header field by
                    specifying its name and value. The header field name can be
                    represented literally or as a reference to an entry in
                    either the static table or the dynamic table. The header
                    field value is represented literally.

                To limit the memory requirements on the decoder side, the

                    The size of the dynamic table is the sum of the size of its
                    entries.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The size of an entry is the sum of its name's length in
                    octets (as defined in <xref
                    target="string.literal.representation" />), its value's
                    length in octets (see <xref

                <t>
                    The size of an entry is calculated using the length of the

                <t>
                    NOTE: The additional 32 octets account for the overhead
                    associated with an entry. For example, an entry structure
                    using two 64-bit pointers to reference the name and the
                    value of the entry, and two 64-bit integers for counting
                    the number of references to the name and value would have
                    32 octets of overhead.

                <t>
                    Protocols that use HPACK determine the maximum size that the
                    encoder is permitted to use for the dynamic table.  In
                    HTTP/2, this value is determined by the
                    SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE setting (see <xref target="HTTP2"
                        x:fmt="of" x:rel="#SettingValues"/>).
                </t>
                <t>
                    An encoder can choose to use less capacity than this maximum
                    size (see <xref target="encoding.context.update"/>), but the
                    chosen size MUST stay lower than or equal to the maximum set
                    by the protocol.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The maximum size of the dynamic table can be changed by the
                    protocol at any time other than during the encoding of a
                    header block.  After changing the maximum size of the
                    dynamic table used by the encoder, the encoder MUST signal
                    this change via an encoding context update (see <xref
                    target="encoding.context.update"/>).  This encoding context
                    update MUST occur at the beginning of the first header block
                    following the change to the header table size.  In HTTP/2,
                    this follows a settings acknowledgement (see <xref
                    target="HTTP2" x:fmt="of" x:rel="#SettingsSync"/>).
                </t>
                <t>
                    Multiple updates to the maximum table size can occur between
                    the sending of two header blocks.  In the case that this
                    size is changed more than once in this interval, the
                    smallest maximum table size that occurs in that interval
                    MUST be sent in an encoding context update.  The final
                    maximum size is always sent, resulting in at most two
                    encoding context updates.  This ensures that the decoder is
                    able to perform eviction based on reductions in decoder
                    table size (see <xref target="entry.eviction"/>).
                </t>
                <t>
                    This mechanism can be used to completely clear entries from
                    the dynamic table by setting a maximum size of 0, which can
                    subsequently be restored.

                    This integer representation allows for values of indefinite
                    size.  It is also possible for an encoder to send a large
                    number of zero values, which can waste octets and could be
                    used to overflow integer values.  Excessively large integer
                    encodings - in value or octet length - MUST be treated as a
                    decoding error.  Different limits can be set for each of the
                    different uses of integers, based on implementation
                    constraints.

                    String literals which use Huffman encoding are encoded with
                    the Huffman code defined in <xref target="huffman.code"/>
                    (see examples for requests in <xref

                    encoded data is the bitwise concatenation of the codes
                    corresponding to each octet of the string literal.

                <t>
                    As the Huffman encoded data doesn't always end at an octet
                    boundary, some padding is inserted after it, up to the next
                    octet boundary. To prevent this padding to be misinterpreted
                    as part of the string literal, the most significant bits of
                    the code corresponding to the EOS (end-of-string) symbol are
                    used.

                <t>
                    Upon decoding, an incomplete code at the end of the
                    encoded data is to be considered as padding and discarded. A
                    padding strictly longer than 7 bits MUST be treated as a
                    decoding error. A padding not corresponding to the most
                    significant bits of the code for the EOS symbol MUST be
                    treated as a decoding error. A Huffman encoded string
                    literal containing the EOS symbol MUST be treated as a
                    decoding error.

                    HPACK reduces the length of header field encodings by
                    exploiting the redundancy inherent in protocols like HTTP.
                    The ultimate goal of this is to reduce the amount of data
                    that is required to send HTTP requests or responses.

                <t>
                    The compression context used to encode header fields can be
                    probed by an attacker who can both define header fields to
                    be encoded and transmitted and observe the length of those
                    fields once they are encoded. When an attacker can do both,
                    they can adaptively modify requests in order to confirm
                    guesses about the dynamic table state. If a guess is
                    compressed into a shorter length, the attacker can observe
                    the encoded length and infer that the guess was correct.

                <t>
                    This is possible even over TLS, because while TLS provides

                    limited amount of protection for the length of that content.

                        Users of HTTP that require confidentiality for header

                        guessing infeasible.  However, this is impractical as a

                        take steps to mitigate attacks.  It would impose new

                        Rather than impose constraints on users of HTTP, an

                        Header field values that are added to the table are
                        attributed to an entity, and only the entity that

                <t>
                    An attacker can try to cause an endpoint to exhaust its
                    memory. HPACK is designed to limit both the peak and state
                    amounts of memory allocated by an endpoint.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The amount of memory used by the compressor state is limited
                    by the decoder using the value of the HTTP/2 setting
                    parameter SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE (see <xref
                        target="HTTP2" x:fmt="of" x:rel="#SettingValues"/>).
                    This limit takes into account both the size of the data
                    stored in the dynamic table, plus a small allowance for
                    overhead.
                </t>
                <t>
                    A decoder can limit the amount of state memory used by
                    setting an appropriate value for the
                    SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE parameter.  An encoder can limit
                    the amount of state memory it uses by signalling lower
                    dynamic table size than the decoder allows (see <xref
                        target="encoding.context.update"/>).
                </t>
                <t>
                    The amount of temporary memory consumed by an encoder or
                    decoder can be limited by processing header fields
                    sequentially.  An implementation does not need to retain a
                    complete list of header fields.  Note however that it might
                    be necessary for an application to retain a complete header
                    list for other reasons; even though HPACK does not force
                    this to occur, application constraints might make this
                    necessary.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Implementation Limits">
                <t>
                    An implementation of HPACK needs to ensure that large values
                    for integers, long encoding for integers, or long string
                    literals do not create security weaknesses.
                </t>
                <t>
                    An implementation has to set a limit for the values it
                    accepts for integers, as well as for the encoded length (see
                    <xref target="integer.representation"/>).  In the same way,
                    it has to set a limit to the length it accepts for string
                    literals (see <xref
                        target="string.literal.representation"/>).

                The static table (see <xref target="static.table"/>) consists of
                a predefined and unchangeable list of header fields.
            </t>
            <t>
                The static table was created by listing the most common
                header fields that are valid for messages exchanged inside a
                HTTP/2 connection. For header fields with a few frequent
                values, an entry was added for each of these frequent values.
                For other header fields, an entry was added with an empty
                value.
            </t>
            <t>
                The following table lists the pre-defined header fields that

        <section title="Huffman Code" anchor="huffman.code">
            <t>
                The following Huffman code is used when encoding string literals
                with a Huffman coding (see <xref
                    target="string.literal.representation"/>).
            </t>
            <t>
                This Huffman code was generated from statistics obtained on a
                large sample of HTTP headers. It is a canonical Huffman code
                (see <xref target="CANONICAL"/>) with some tweaking to ensure
                that no symbol has a unique code length.
            </t>
            <t>
                Each row in the table defines the code used to represent a
                symbol:
                <list style="hanging">
                    <t hangText="sym:">
                        The symbol to be represented. It is the decimal value of
                        an octet, possibly prepended with its ASCII
                        representation. A specific symbol, "EOS", is used to
                        indicate the end of a string literal.
                    </t>
                    <t hangText="code as bits:">
                        The Huffman code for the symbol represented as a base-2
                        integer, aligned on the most significant bit (MSB).
                    </t>
                    <t hangText="code as hex:">
                        The Huffman code for the symbol, represented as a
                        hexadecimal integer, aligned on the least significant
                        bit (LSB).
                    </t>
                    <t hangText="len:">
                        The number of bits for the code representing the symbol.
                    </t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                As an example, the code for the symbol 47 (corresponding to the
                ASCII character "/") consists in the 6 bits "0", "1", "1", "0",
                "0", "0". This corresponds to the value 0x18 (in hexadecimal)
                encoded on 6 bits.

        HTTP responses, on the same connection. The HTTP/2 setting parameter
        SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE is set to the value of 256 octets, causing

<section title="Response Examples with Huffman Coding"
    anchor="response.examples.with.huffman.coding">
    <t>
        This section shows the same examples as the previous section, but using
        Huffman encoding for the literal values. The HTTP/2 setting parameter
        SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE is set to the value of 256 octets, causing
        some evictions to occur. The eviction mechanism uses the length of the
        decoded literal values, so the same evictions occurs as in the previous
        section.

                            works. This also changes the working of the

                            Added text about duplicate header entry encoding.
                            Clarified some language w.r.t Header Set.  Changed
                            x-my-header to mynewheader. Added text in the
                            HeaderEmission section indicating that the
                            application may also be able to free up memory more
