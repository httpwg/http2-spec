<t>
   HTTP provides a simple challenge-response authentication mechanism
   that can be used by a server to challenge a client request and by a
   client to provide authentication information. It uses an extensible,
   case-insensitive token to identify the authentication scheme, followed
   by additional information necessary for achieving authentication via that
   scheme. The latter can either be a comma-separated list of parameters or a
   single sequence of characters capable of holding base64-encoded
   information.
</t>
<t>
   Parameters are name-value pairs where the name is matched case-insensitively,
   and each parameter name &MUST; only occur once per challenge.
</t>

                       "-" / "." / "_" / "~" / "+" / "/" ) *"=" 
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   The "token68" syntax allows the 66 unreserved URI characters (<xref target="RFC3986"/>),
   plus a few others, so that it can hold a base64, base64url (URL and filename
   safe alphabet), base32, or base16 (hex) encoding, with or without padding, but
   excluding whitespace (<xref target="RFC4648"/>). 
</t>
<t>
   The <x:ref>401 (Unauthorized)</x:ref> response message is used by an origin server
   to challenge the authorization of a user agent. This response &MUST;
   include a <x:ref>WWW-Authenticate</x:ref> header field containing at least one
   challenge applicable to the requested resource.
</t>
<t>   
   The <x:ref>407 (Proxy Authentication Required)</x:ref> response message is
   used by a proxy to challenge the authorization of a client and &MUST;
   include a <x:ref>Proxy-Authenticate</x:ref> header field containing at least
   one challenge applicable to the proxy for the requested resource.
</t>

</artwork></figure>
<x:note>
  <t>
     &Note; User agents will need to take special care in parsing the
     <x:ref>WWW-Authenticate</x:ref> and <x:ref>Proxy-Authenticate</x:ref>
     header field values because they can contain more than one challenge, or
     if more than one of each is provided, since the contents of a challenge
     can itself contain a comma-separated list of authentication parameters.
  </t>
</x:note>
<x:note>
  <t>
     &Note; Many clients fail to parse challenges containing unknown
     schemes. A workaround for this problem is to list well-supported schemes
     (such as "basic") first.<!-- see http://greenbytes.de/tech/tc/httpauth/#multibasicunknown2 -->
  </t>
</x:note>
<t>
   A user agent that wishes to authenticate itself with an origin server
   &mdash; usually, but not necessarily, after receiving a <x:ref>401 (Unauthorized)</x:ref>
   &mdash; can do so by including an <x:ref>Authorization</x:ref> header field with the
   request.
</t>
<t>   
   A client that wishes to authenticate itself with a proxy &mdash; usually,
   but not necessarily, after receiving a <x:ref>407 (Proxy Authentication Required)</x:ref>
   &mdash; can do so by including a <x:ref>Proxy-Authorization</x:ref> header field with the
   request.
</t>
<t>
   Both the <x:ref>Authorization</x:ref> field value and the <x:ref>Proxy-Authorization</x:ref> field value
   contain the client's credentials for the realm of the resource being
   requested, based upon a challenge received from the server (possibly at
   some point in the past). When creating their values, the user agent ought to
   do so by selecting the challenge with what it considers to be the most
   secure auth-scheme that it understands, obtaining credentials from the user
   as appropriate.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="credentials"/>
  <x:ref>credentials</x:ref> = <x:ref>auth-scheme</x:ref> [ 1*<x:ref>SP</x:ref> ( <x:ref>token68</x:ref> / #<x:ref>auth-param</x:ref> ) ]
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Upon a request for a protected resource that omits credentials, contains
   invalid credentials (e.g., a bad password) or partial credentials (e.g.,
   when the authentication scheme requires more than one round trip), an origin
   server &SHOULD; send a <x:ref>401 (Unauthorized)</x:ref> response that
   contains a <x:ref>WWW-Authenticate</x:ref> header field with at least one
   (possibly new) challenge applicable to the requested resource.
</t>
<t>
   Likewise, upon a request that requires authentication by proxies that omit
   credentials or contain invalid or partial credentials, a proxy &SHOULD;
   send a <x:ref>407 (Proxy Authentication Required)</x:ref> response that
   contains a <x:ref>Proxy-Authenticate</x:ref> header field with a (possibly
   new) challenge applicable to the proxy.
</t>
<t>
   A server receiving credentials that are valid, but not adequate to gain
   access, ought to respond with the <x:ref>403 (Forbidden)</x:ref> status code (&status.403;).
</t>
<t>
   The HTTP protocol does not restrict applications to this simple
   challenge-response mechanism for access authentication. Additional
   mechanisms &MAY; be used, such as encryption at the transport level or
   via message encapsulation, and with additional header fields
   specifying authentication information. However, such additional
   mechanisms are not defined by this specification.
</t>
<t>
   Proxies &MUST; forward the <x:ref>WWW-Authenticate</x:ref> and
   <x:ref>Authorization</x:ref> header fields unmodified and follow the rules
   found in <xref target="header.authorization"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Protection Space (Realm)" anchor="protection.space">
  <iref item="Protection Space"/>
  <iref item="Realm"/>
  <iref item="Canonical Root URI"/>
<t>
   The authentication parameter realm is reserved for use by authentication
   schemes that wish to indicate the scope of protection.
</t>
<t>
   A <x:dfn>protection space</x:dfn> is defined by the canonical root URI (the
   scheme and authority components of the effective request URI; see
   <xref target="Part1" x:fmt="of" x:rel="#effective.request.uri"/>) of the
   server being accessed, in combination with the realm value if present.
   These realms allow the protected resources on a server to be
   partitioned into a set of protection spaces, each with its own
   authentication scheme and/or authorization database. The realm value
   is a string, generally assigned by the origin server, that can have
   additional semantics specific to the authentication scheme. Note that
   there can be multiple challenges with the same auth-scheme but
   different realms.
</t>
<t>
   The protection space determines the domain over which credentials can
   be automatically applied. If a prior request has been authorized, the
   same credentials &MAY; be reused for all other requests within that
   protection space for a period of time determined by the
   authentication scheme, parameters, and/or user preference. Unless
   otherwise defined by the authentication scheme, a single protection
   space cannot extend outside the scope of its server.
</t>
<t>
   For historical reasons, senders &MUST; only use the quoted-string syntax.
   Recipients might have to support both token and quoted-string syntax for
   maximum interoperability with existing clients that have been accepting both
   notations for a long time.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Authentication Scheme Registry" anchor="authentication.scheme.registry">
<t>
  The HTTP Authentication Scheme Registry defines the name space for the
  authentication schemes in challenges and credentials.
</t>
<t>
  Registrations &MUST; include the following fields:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>Authentication Scheme Name</t>
    <t>Pointer to specification text</t>
    <t>Notes (optional)</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  Values to be added to this name space require IETF Review
  (see <xref target="RFC5226" x:fmt="," x:sec="4.1"/>).
</t>
<t>
  The registry itself is maintained at <eref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-authschemes"/>.
</t>

<section title="Considerations for New Authentication Schemes" anchor="considerations.for.new.authentication.schemes">
<t>
  There are certain aspects of the HTTP Authentication Framework that put
  constraints on how new authentication schemes can work:
</t>
<t>
  <list style="symbols">
    <x:lt>
    <t>
      HTTP authentication is presumed to be stateless: all of the information
      necessary to authenticate a request &MUST; be provided in the request,
      rather than be dependent on the server remembering prior requests.
      Authentication based on, or bound to, the underlying connection is
      outside the scope of this specification and inherently flawed unless
      steps are taken to ensure that the connection cannot be used by any
      party other than the authenticated user
      (see &msg-orient-and-buffering;). 
    </t>
    </x:lt>
    <x:lt>
    <t>
      The authentication parameter "realm" is reserved for defining Protection
      Spaces as defined in <xref target="protection.space"/>. New schemes
      &MUST-NOT; use it in a way incompatible with that definition.
    </t>
    </x:lt>
    <x:lt>
    <t>
      The "token68" notation was introduced for compatibility with existing
      authentication schemes and can only be used once per challenge/credentials.
      New schemes thus ought to use the "auth-param" syntax instead, because
      otherwise future extensions will be impossible.
    </t>
    </x:lt>
    <x:lt>
    <t>
      The parsing of challenges and credentials is defined by this specification,
      and cannot be modified by new authentication schemes. When the auth-param
      syntax is used, all parameters ought to support both token and
      quoted-string syntax, and syntactical constraints ought to be defined on
      the field value after parsing (i.e., quoted-string processing). This is
      necessary so that recipients can use a generic parser that applies to
      all authentication schemes.
    </t>
    <t>
      &Note; The fact that the value syntax for the "realm" parameter
      is restricted to quoted-string was a bad design choice not to be repeated
      for new parameters.
    </t>
    </x:lt>
    <x:lt>
    <t>
      Definitions of new schemes ought to define the treatment of unknown
      extension parameters. In general, a "must-ignore" rule is preferable
      over "must-understand", because otherwise it will be hard to introduce
      new parameters in the presence of legacy recipients. Furthermore,
      it's good to describe the policy for defining new parameters (such
      as "update the specification", or "use this registry"). 
    </t>
    </x:lt>
    <x:lt>
    <t>
      Authentication schemes need to document whether they are usable in
      origin-server authentication (i.e., using <x:ref>WWW-Authenticate</x:ref>),
      and/or proxy authentication (i.e., using <x:ref>Proxy-Authenticate</x:ref>).
    </t>
    </x:lt>
    <x:lt>
    <t>
      The credentials carried in an <x:ref>Authorization</x:ref> header field are specific to
      the User Agent, and therefore have the same effect on HTTP caches as the
      "private" Cache-Control response directive, within the scope of the
      request they appear in.
    </t>
    <t>
      Therefore, new authentication schemes that choose not to carry
      credentials in the <x:ref>Authorization</x:ref> header field (e.g., using a newly defined
      header field) will need to explicitly disallow caching, by mandating the use of
      either Cache-Control request directives (e.g., "no-store") or response
      directives (e.g., "private").

  <x:anchor-alias value="401 (Unauthorized)"/>
<t>
   The <x:dfn>401 (Unauthorized)</x:dfn> status code indicates that the
   request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication
   credentials for the target resource. The origin server &MUST; send a
   <x:ref>WWW-Authenticate</x:ref> header field (<xref target="header.www-authenticate"/>)
   containing at least one challenge applicable to the target resource.
   If the request included authentication credentials, then the 401 response
   indicates that authorization has been refused for those credentials.
   The client &MAY; repeat the request with a new or replaced
   <x:ref>Authorization</x:ref> header field (<xref target="header.authorization"/>).
   If the 401 response contains the same challenge as the prior response, and
   the user agent has already attempted authentication at least once, then the

   The proxy &MUST; send a <x:ref>Proxy-Authenticate</x:ref> header field
   (<xref target="header.proxy-authenticate"/>) containing a challenge
   applicable to that proxy for the target resource. The client &MAY; repeat

<t>
   Unlike <x:ref>WWW-Authenticate</x:ref>, the Proxy-Authenticate header field
   applies only to the current connection, and intermediaries &SHOULD-NOT;
   forward it to downstream clients. However, an intermediate proxy might need
   to obtain its own credentials by requesting them from the downstream client,
   which in some circumstances will appear as if the proxy is forwarding the
   Proxy-Authenticate header field.
</t>
<t>
   Note that the parsing considerations for <x:ref>WWW-Authenticate</x:ref>
   apply to this header field as well; see <xref target="header.www-authenticate"/>
   for details.
</t>

<section title="Proxy-Authorization" anchor="header.proxy-authorization">
  <iref primary="true" item="Proxy-Authorization header field" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="Proxy-Authorization"/>
<t>
   The "Proxy-Authorization" header field allows the client to
   identify itself (or its user) to a proxy that requires
   authentication. Its value consists of
   credentials containing the authentication information of the user
   agent for the proxy and/or realm of the resource being requested.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="Proxy-Authorization"/>
  <x:ref>Proxy-Authorization</x:ref> = <x:ref>credentials</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   Unlike <x:ref>Authorization</x:ref>, the Proxy-Authorization header field applies only to
   the next outbound proxy that demanded authentication using the <x:ref>Proxy-Authenticate</x:ref>
   field. When multiple proxies are used in a chain, the
   Proxy-Authorization header field is consumed by the first outbound
   proxy that was expecting to receive credentials. A proxy &MAY; relay
   the credentials from the client request to the next proxy if that is
   the mechanism by which the proxies cooperatively authenticate a given
   request.
</t>
</section>

<section title="WWW-Authenticate" anchor="header.www-authenticate">
  <iref primary="true" item="WWW-Authenticate header field" x:for-anchor=""/>
  <x:anchor-alias value="WWW-Authenticate"/>
<t>
   The "WWW-Authenticate" header field consists of at least one
   challenge that indicates the authentication scheme(s) and parameters
   applicable to the effective request URI (&effective-request-uri;).
</t>
<t>   
   It &MUST; be included in <x:ref>401 (Unauthorized)</x:ref> response messages and &MAY; be
   included in other response messages to indicate that supplying credentials
   (or different credentials) might affect the response.
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616"><iref primary="true" item="Grammar" subitem="WWW-Authenticate"/>
  <x:ref>WWW-Authenticate</x:ref> = 1#<x:ref>challenge</x:ref>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   User agents are advised to take special care in parsing the WWW-Authenticate
   field value as it might contain more than one challenge,
   or if more than one WWW-Authenticate header field is provided, the
   contents of a challenge itself can contain a comma-separated list of
   authentication parameters.
</t>
<figure>
  <preamble>For instance:</preamble>
  <artwork type="example">
  WWW-Authenticate: Newauth realm="apps", type=1,
                    title="Login to \"apps\"", Basic realm="simple"
</artwork>
  <postamble>
  This header field contains two challenges; one for the "Newauth" scheme
  with a realm value of "apps", and two additional parameters "type" and
  "title", and another one for the "Basic" scheme with a realm value of
  "simple".
</postamble></figure>
<x:note>
  <t>
    &Note; The challenge grammar production uses the list syntax as 
    well. Therefore, a sequence of comma, whitespace, and comma can be
    considered both as applying to the preceding challenge, or to be an
    empty entry in the list of challenges. In practice, this ambiguity
    does not affect the semantics of the header field value and thus is
    harmless.

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security.considerations">
<t>
   This section is meant to inform developers, information providers, and
   users of known security concerns specific to HTTP/1.1 authentication.
   More general security considerations are addressed in HTTP messaging
   &messaging; and semantics &semantics;.
</t>

<section title="Authentication Credentials and Idle Clients" anchor="auth.credentials.and.idle.clients">
<t>
   Existing HTTP clients and user agents typically retain authentication
   information indefinitely. HTTP/1.1 does not provide a method for a
   server to direct clients to discard these cached credentials. This is
   a significant defect that requires further extensions to HTTP.
   Circumstances under which credential caching can interfere with the
   application's security model include but are not limited to:
  <list style="symbols">
     <t>Clients that have been idle for an extended period, following
        which the server might wish to cause the client to re-prompt the
        user for credentials.</t>

     <t>Applications that include a session termination indication
        (such as a "logout" or "commit" button on a page) after which
        the server side of the application "knows" that there is no
        further reason for the client to retain the credentials.</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   This is currently under separate study. There are a number of work-arounds
   to parts of this problem, and we encourage the use of
   password protection in screen savers, idle time-outs, and other
   methods that mitigate the security problems inherent in this
   problem. In particular, user agents that cache credentials are
   encouraged to provide a readily accessible mechanism for discarding
   cached credentials under user control.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Protection Spaces" anchor="protection.spaces">
<t>
  Authentication schemes that solely rely on the "realm" mechanism for
  establishing a protection space will expose credentials to all resources on a
  server. Clients that have successfully made authenticated requests with a
  resource can use the same authentication credentials for other resources on
  the same server. This makes it possible for a different resource to harvest
  authentication credentials for other resources.
</t>
<t>
  This is of particular concern when a server hosts resources for multiple
  parties under the same canonical root URI (<xref target="protection.space"/>).
  Possible mitigation strategies include restricting direct access to
  authentication credentials (i.e., not making the content of the
  <x:ref>Authorization</x:ref> request header field available), and separating protection
  spaces by using a different host name for each party.
</t>

<t>
  The framework for HTTP Authentication is now defined by this document,

  The "realm" parameter is no longer always required on challenges;
  consequently, the ABNF allows challenges without any auth parameters.

<t>
  The "token68" alternative to auth-param lists has been added for consistency
  with legacy authentication schemes such as "Basic".
