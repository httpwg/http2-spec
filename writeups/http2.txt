# Summary

Mark Nottingham is the Document Shepherd and Working Group Chair. Barry Leiba is the responsible Area Director.

This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple concurrent messages on the same connection. It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients.

This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message syntax. HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.

We intend this to be published as a Proposed Standard.


# Review and Consensus

We have enjoyed active participation from a broad community, including browser vendors, intermediaries (such as CDN and proxy vendors), server vendors and protocol library authors; this includes both commercial vendors and open source libraries.

Our current implementation list is at:
  https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Implementations
  
Additionally, we have had participation and review from the non-implementing HTTP community itself. We have substantial external interest from the Web performance community as well.

We have also coordinated with the W3C, giving them regular updates through the liaison and the TAG.

Process-wise, we were chartered to do this work in August 2012, with a submission deadline of November 2014. We have treated that date seriously, so as to bound the commitment of the developers and implementers involved. As a result, we had a fairly high frequency of interim meetings (six in two years), used both to discuss issues and to hold interop events.

Perhaps inevitably, there have been a number of contentious issues in the development of HTTP/2. The most notable are listed below; a full listing of design issues can be found at:

## Requiring Encryption

HTTP/2 used SPDY as a starting point, and SPDY was only ever implemented over TLS for HTTPS URLs. 

There were many in the Working Group who felt that this constraint should be explicit in the new protocol. They were motivated not only by the Snowden revelations, but also other common (and currently passive) attacks upon HTTP, such as "FireSheep" coffee shop sniffing and the Google "drive-by wifi" sniffing attacks.

Implementing the protocol over TLS also improves interoperability, since middleboxes aren't generally able to manipulate the plaintext -- a perennial problem for HTTP evolution and conformance.

The Working Group had a wide-ranging discussion about this topic, mostly during and between the August 2013 (Berlin) and January 2014 (Zurich) meetings.

We considered requiring the use of TLS (through https:// URIs) for HTTP/2. However, some members of the community pushed back against this, on the grounds that it would be too onerous for some uses of HTTP (not necessarily CPU; cost and administration of certificates was cited as a burden, as was the follow-on disruption to applications, since transitioning from HTTP to HTTPS often requires non-trivial content changes, due to the way that the browser security model works).

As a result, we decided to document the use of HTTP/2 for both https:// and http:// URLs, the latter in cleartext (the "h2c" protocol ID), leaving it up to implementations to decide what they support.

The WG also discussed an "Opportunistic Security" approach to using TLS for http:// URIs (but without authentication). This was a bit controversial too, as some community members felt that having another, weaker kind of security defined harms the long-term deployment of "full" TLS.

After discussion in June 2014 (New York) we agreed to adopt this document as an optional extension, but only with Experimental status: <http://httpwg.github.io/http-extensions/encryption.html>. It's expected that we'll ship it shortly after HTTP/2.

Overall, I would characterize the WG a having a somewhat uneasy (but also pragmatic) consensus on this outcome. 

To date, we've had one browser implementation express an intent to requiring https:// URLs for HTTP/2 (i.e., no http://), one interested in https:// as well as Opportunistic Security for http:// URLs (but not cleartext http://), and one that is interested in https:// as well as cleartext http://.

Note that most of the justification for our decision not to require https:// for HTTP/2 seems to be predicated on this part of our charter <http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/charter/>:

"The resulting specification(s) are expected to meet these goals for common existing deployments of HTTP[.]"

... i.e., it was argued and accepted, based on this text, that requiring people who can't use https:// should just stay on HTTP/1.1 was unacceptable. This charter text was written before BCP188 (and the incidents leading up to it), and also predates the IAB statement on Internet Confidentiality.

# Intellectual Property

Confirm that each author has stated that their direct, personal knowledge of any IPR related to this document has already been disclosed, in conformance with BCPs 78 and 79. Explain briefly the working group discussion about any IPR disclosures regarding this document, and summarize the outcome.


# Other Points

This document has the following downward references:

* FIPS186 (Non-RFC) - not in downref registry
* RFC2818 (Informational) - in downref registry
* RFC5289 (Informational) - not in downref registry

IDNits reports a few warnings; these appear to be spurious.

This document creates three new registries:

* HTTP/2 Frame Type
* HTTP/2 Settings
* HTTP/2 Error Code

The Working Group discussed and selected these policies in the process of creating these fields; the choices of policy were not contentious. IANA is advised to select experts that are familiar with HTTP/2 and its operation, and with ties to the HTTP community.
